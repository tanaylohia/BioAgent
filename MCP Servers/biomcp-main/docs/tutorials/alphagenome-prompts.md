## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Required Information

- **Chromosome**: Use "chr" prefix (e.g., chr7, chrX)
- **Position**: 1-based coordinate from reference genome
- **Reference allele**: Current base(s) at that position
- **Alternate allele**: Changed base(s)

### Optional Parameters

- **Interval size**: 2048, 16384, 131072, 524288, or 1048576
- **Tissue type**: UBERON ontology terms
- **Multiple variants**: Analyze in single prompt for comparison

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Include exact coordinates
2. **Provide context** - Mention gene names and known effects
3. **Ask for interpretation** - Request specific insights
4. **Combine tools** - Use multiple BioMCP tools for comprehensive analysis
5. **Consider mechanism** - Ask about expression, splicing, or chromatin

## Example Multi-Step Workflow

```
I'm investigating a patient with suspected hereditary cancer syndrome. They have these variants:

1. First, check each variant in databases:
   - Use variant_getter on chr17:41245237 G>A
   - Use variant_getter on chr13:32340700 G>A
   - Use variant_getter on chr11:108198135 C>T

2. Then predict regulatory effects:
   - Use alphagenome_predictor on each variant
   - Compare which has the strongest impact

3. Search literature:
   - Find articles about each affected gene
   - Look for similar cases

4. Summarize findings:
   - Which variant is most likely pathogenic?
   - What functional evidence supports this?
```

This structured approach combines AlphaGenome's predictive power with BioMCP's database access for comprehensive variant analysis.
