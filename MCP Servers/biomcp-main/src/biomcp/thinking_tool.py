separate from the main search functionality.

    """REQUIRED FIRST STEP: Perform structured sequential thinking for ANY biomedical research task.

    üö® IMPORTANT: You MUST use this tool BEFORE any search or fetch operations when:
    - Researching ANY biomedical topic (genes, diseases, variants, trials)
    - Planning to use multiple BioMCP tools
    - Answering questions that require analysis or synthesis
    - Comparing information from different sources
    - Making recommendations or drawing conclusions

    ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO USE THIS TOOL FIRST will result in:
    - Incomplete or poorly structured analysis
    - Missing important connections between data
    - Suboptimal search strategies
    - Overlooked critical information

    Sequential thinking ensures you:
    1. Fully understand the research question
    2. Plan an optimal search strategy
    3. Identify all relevant data sources
    4. Structure your analysis properly
    5. Deliver comprehensive, well-reasoned results

    ## Usage Pattern:
    1. Start with thoughtNumber=1 to initiate analysis
    2. Progress through numbered thoughts sequentially
    3. Adjust totalThoughts estimate as understanding develops
    4. Set nextThoughtNeeded=False only when analysis is complete

    ## Example:
    ```python
    # Initial analysis
    await think(
        thought="Breaking down the relationship between BRAF mutations and melanoma treatment resistance...",
        thoughtNumber=1,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )

    # Continue analysis
    await think(
        thought="Examining specific BRAF V600E mutation mechanisms...",
        thoughtNumber=2,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )

    # Final thought
    await think(
        thought="Synthesizing findings and proposing research directions...",
        thoughtNumber=5,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=False
    )
    ```

    ## Important Notes:
    - Each thought builds on previous ones within a session
    - State is maintained throughout the MCP session
    - Use thoughtful, detailed analysis in each step
    - Revisions and branching are supported through the underlying implementation
