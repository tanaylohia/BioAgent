# Environment variables for the worker
# These can be overridden in several ways:
# 1. In the Cloudflare dashboard under Workers & Pages > your-worker > Settings > Variables
# 2. Using wrangler CLI: wrangler secret put REMOTE_MCP_SERVER_URL
# 3. During local development: wrangler dev --var REMOTE_MCP_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8000"
# 4. In your CI/CD pipeline using environment variables with the format CF_REMOTE_MCP_SERVER_URL
REMOTE_MCP_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # Replace with your MCP server URL in production

# Stytch OAuth Configuration
# Replace these placeholder values with your actual Stytch credentials
# For development, use test credentials from https://stytch.com/dashboard
# For production, use production credentials and api.stytch.com instead of test.stytch.com
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID      = "project-test-xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with your Stytch Project ID
STYTCH_SECRET          = "secret-test-xxxxxxxxxxxx"   # Replace with your Stytch Secret (use wrangler secret for production)
STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN    = "public-token-test-xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with your Stytch Public Token
STYTCH_API_URL = "https://test.stytch.com/v1"  # Use https://api.stytch.com/v1 for production
STYTCH_OAUTH_URL = "https://test.stytch.com/v1/public/oauth/google/start"  # Update for production

# Debug mode - set to true for development, false for production
DEBUG = false

# JWT Secret for signing tokens - use a strong, unique secret in production
# For production, set this as a secret: wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
JWT_SECRET = "replace-with-a-strong-secret-key"

# BigQuery variables
# For production, set these as secrets or environment variables:
# wrangler secret put BQ_PROJECT_ID
# wrangler secret put BQ_DATASET
# wrangler secret put BQ_SA_KEY_JSON
BQ_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # Replace with your actual project ID in production
BQ_DATASET = "your_dataset_name"   # Replace with your actual dataset in production
BQ_TABLE="worker_logs"

# Sensitive variables should be stored in the Cloudflare dashboard under Workers & Pages > your-worker > Settings > Secrets
# OR you can declare them using npx wrangler secret put BQ_SA_KEY_JSON
# Potential secrets:
# BQ_SA_KEY_JSON
# STYTCH_SECRET


# Note: The ability to allow plaintext connections is now configured in the Cloudflare dashboard
# under Security settings for your Worker
