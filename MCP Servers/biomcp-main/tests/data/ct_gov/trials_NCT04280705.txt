### Description Module
Brief Summary:
  This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in
  hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter
  trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally.
  The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a
  control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and
  allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy
  proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm
  for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change
  would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background
  standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is
  learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety
  and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized
  subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
  actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study
  closure or changes to study arms. To evaluate the clinical efficacy, as
  assessed by time to recovery, of different investigational therapeutics
  as compared to the control arm.
Detailed Description:
  This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in
  hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter
  trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally.
  The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a
  control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and
  allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy
  proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm
  for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change
  would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background
  standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is
  learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety
  and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized
  subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
  actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study
  closure or changes to study arms.

  The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400
  subjects with a "recovered" status (per the primary objective). The
  primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled in order to
  400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup
  (those with baseline status of "Hospitalized, requiring supplemental
  oxygen" or "Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring
  ongoing medical care") is also of public health importance. Hence,
  enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, 2020 to ensure
  400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important
  subgroup. With recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600
  to over 800.

  Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are
  discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15,
  22, and 29 as an outpatient. For discharged subjects, it is preferred
  that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory
  tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research
  as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other
  restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the
  clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone,
  and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have
  laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by
  phone.

  All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory
  assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma)
  research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1
  (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP
  swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be
  collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or
  are still hospitalized).

  The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary
  outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal
  scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of
  COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size
  reassessment.

Measure: Time to an Improvement of at Least Two Categories Using an Ordinal Scale
Description:
  The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first
  assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2)
  Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal
  membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive
  ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring
  supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen
  - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6)
  Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires
  ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities
  and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospitalized, no limitations on
  activities. Time to improvement by at least two categories was
  determined for each participant
Time Frame: Day 1 through Day 29

#### Secondary Outcomes
Measure:
  Time to Discharge or to a NEWS of 2 or Less and Maintained for 24 Hours,
  Whichever Occurs First
Description:
  The NEW score has demonstrated an ability to discriminate patients at
  risk of poor outcomes. This score is based on 7 clinical parameters
  (respiration rate, oxygen saturation, any supplemental oxygen,
  temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, level of
  consciousness). The NEW Score is being used as an efficacy measure. The
  minimum score is 0, representing the better outcome, and the maximum
  value is 19, representing the worse outcome. The time to discharge or a
  NEWS of less than or equal to 2 was determined for each participant.
Time Frame: Day 1 through Day 29

Title: Change in National Early Warning Score (NEWS) From Baseline
Description:
  The NEW score has demonstrated an ability to discriminate patients at
  risk of poor outcomes. This score is based on 7 clinical parameters
  (respiration rate, oxygen saturation, any supplemental oxygen,
  temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, level of
  consciousness). The NEW Score is being used as an efficacy measure. The
  minimum score is 0, representing the better outcome, and the maximum
  value is 19, representing the worse outcome.

Description:
  The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first
  assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2)
  Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal
  membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive
  ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring
  supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen
  - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6)
  Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires
  ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities
  and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospitalized, no limitations on

Title:
  Time to Discharge or to a NEWS of 2 or Less and Maintained for 24 Hours,
  Whichever Occurs First
Description:
  The NEW score has demonstrated an ability to discriminate patients at
  risk of poor outcomes. This score is based on 7 clinical parameters
  (respiration rate, oxygen saturation, any supplemental oxygen,
  temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, level of
  consciousness). The NEW Score is being used as an efficacy measure. The
  minimum score is 0, representing the better outcome, and the maximum
  value is 19, representing the worse outcome. The time to discharge or a
  NEWS of less than or equal to 2 was determined for each participant.

### Adverse Events Module
Frequency Threshold: 5
Time Frame:
  Grade 3 and 4 serious and non-serious adverse events were collected for
  29 days after the first dose. Laboratory values were systematically
  assessed at Days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 while participants were inpatient,
  and at Days 15 and 29.
Description:
  Given the nature of severity of the underlying illness, participants
  were expected to have many symptoms and abnormalities in vital signs and
  laboratory values. All Grade 3 and 4 AEs were captured as AEs in this
  trial. In addition, any Grade 2 or higher, suspected drug-related
  hypersensitivity reaction was to be reported as an AE in this trial. All
  cause mortality was calculated for the ITT population, while SAEs and
  AEs reflect the as treated population.
