Abstract:
  This study was designed to examine the aggressive features of BRAF-
  positive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and association with age.We
  compared the clinicopathologic parameters and BRAF V600E mutation status
  of 121 elderly (age ≥65 years) PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy
  from January 2007 to December 2009 to a consecutive cohort of 98 younger
  (age <65 years) PTC patients.Younger and elderly PTC patients had
  similar incidences of BRAF-positive tumors (41% vs. 38%; p = 0.67). The
  elderly cohort was more likely to have smaller tumors (mean 1.6 vs. 2.1
  cm; p = 0.001), present with advanced TNM stage (36% vs. 19%; p =
  0.008), and have persistent/recurrent disease (10% vs. 1%; p = 0.006).
  BRAF-positive status was associated with PTC that were tall cell variant
  (p < 0.001), had extrathyroidal extension (p < 0.001), lymph node
  involvement (p = 0.008), advanced (III/IV) TNM stage (p < 0.001), and
  disease recurrence (p < 0.001). Except for lymph node involvement, the
  association between aggressive histology characteristics at presentation
  and BRAF-positive PTC also was observed within the age-defined cohorts.
  In short-term follow-up (mean, 18 months), persistent/recurrent PTC was
  much more likely to occur in patients who were both BRAF-positive and
  elderly (22%).BRAF mutations are equally present in younger and older
  patients. Aggressive histology characteristics at presentation are
  associated with BRAF-positive PTC, irrespective of age. However, the
  well-established association of BRAF with recurrence is limited to older
  (age ≥65 years) patients.

Abstract:
  Dabrafenib and trametinib were approved for use as monotherapies in
  BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA) in 2013, and most recently, their use in combination has received
  accelerated FDA approval. Both drugs target the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant
  BRAF that constitutively activates the pathway, and trametinib
  selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 proteins activated by RAF kinases.
  The phase III study of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma
  reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59% objective
  RECIST response rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and
  overall survival (OS) were improved compared with dacarbazine.
  Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for
  vemurafenib, the first FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor. Efficacy has been
  demonstrated in other BRAF-mutant genotypes. The phase III study of
  trametinib in BRAF inhibitor-naïve patients with BRAF(V600E) or
  BRAF(V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS
  compared with chemotherapy. Trametinib is ineffective in patients who
  have progressed on BRAF inhibitors. A phase II trial of combined
  dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer
  median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy, with less cutaneous toxicity.
  Here, we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies
  and in combination, and discuss their role in the management of BRAF-
  mutant melanoma.

Abstract:
  BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma but their prognostic
  significance remains unclear.We sought to further evaluate the
  prognostic value of BRAF mutations in localized cutaneous melanoma.We
  undertook an observational retrospective study of 147 patients with
  localized invasive (stages I and II) cutaneous melanomas to determine
  the prognostic value of BRAF mutation status.After a median follow-up of
  48 months, patients with localized melanomas with BRAF-mutant melanomas
  exhibited poorer disease-free survival than those with BRAF-wt genotype
  (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.3) even after
  adjustment for Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration, location, age, sex,
  and tumor mitotic rate.The retrospective design and the small number of
  events are limitations.Our findings suggest that reappraisal of clinical
  treatment approaches for patients with localized melanoma harboring
  tumors with BRAF mutation might be warranted.

Abstract:
  Melanoma is a disease characterized by lesions that activate ERK.
  Although 70% of cutaneous melanomas harbor activating mutations in the
  BRAF and NRAS genes, the alterations that drive tumor progression in the
  remaining 30% are largely undefined. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor
  of RAF kinases, has clinical utility restricted to BRAF-mutant tumors.
  MEK inhibitors, which have shown clinical activity in NRAS-mutant
  melanoma, may be effective in other ERK pathway-dependent settings.
  Here, we investigated a panel of melanoma cell lines wild type for BRAF
  and NRAS to determine the genetic alteration driving their
  transformation and their dependence on ERK signaling in order to
  elucidate a candidate set for MEK inhibitor treatment. A cohort of the
  BRAF/RAS wild type cell lines with high levels of RAS-GTP had loss of
  NF1, a RAS GTPase activating protein. In these cell lines, the MEK
  inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but also relieved
  feedback inhibition of RAS, resulting in induction of pMEK and a rapid
  rebound in ERK signaling. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor trametinib
  impaired the adaptive response of cells to ERK inhibition, leading to
  sustained suppression of ERK signaling and significant antitumor
  effects. Notably, alterations in NF1 frequently co-occurred with RAS and
  BRAF alterations in melanoma. In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss
  abrogated negative feedback on RAS activation, resulting in elevated
  activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF, but not MEK, inhibitors. We
  conclude that loss of NF1 is common in cutaneous melanoma and is
  associated with RAS activation, MEK-dependence, and resistance to RAF
  inhibition.

Abstract:
  The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of the
  BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and to
  determine the correlation between this mutation and indicators of poor
  prognosis and outcome in patients with PTC. The BRAF V600E mutation
  status was analyzed in 187 tumor samples using the multiplex allele-
  specific PCR method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed
  to investigate the association of the BRAF V600E mutation with clinical
  features and patient outcome. The sensitivity of the multiplex allele-
  specific PCR combined with denaturing high-performance liquid
  chromatography reached ~1%. The BRAF V600E mutation was observed in
  63.6% (119/187) of tumor tissues, predominantly in PTC specimens, and no
  BRAF mutation was identified in other benign-type thyroid diseases. The
  univariate analysis indicated that the BRAF V600E mutation was
  associated with age, tumor stage and prognosis (P<0.05). In addition,
  the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation was significantly different in
  the central (75.3%) and lateral neck (49.3%) lymph nodes of patients
  with lymph node metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
  showed that the BRAF V600E mutation (HR, 2.471; 95% CI, 1.149-5.312) and
  lymph node metastasis (HR, 3.003; 95% CI, 1.027-8.771) are independent
  factors that predict tumor prognosis. Thus, the BRAF V600E mutation is
  an independent risk factor that may be used to predict thyroid cancer
  persistence/recurrence.

Abstract:
  This study was designed to examine the aggressive features of BRAF-
  positive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and association with age.We
  compared the clinicopathologic parameters and BRAF V600E mutation status
  of 121 elderly (age ≥65 years) PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy
  from January 2007 to December 2009 to a consecutive cohort of 98 younger
  (age <65 years) PTC patients.Younger and elderly PTC patients had
  similar incidences of BRAF-positive tumors (41% vs. 38%; p = 0.67). The
  elderly cohort was more likely to have smaller tumors (mean 1.6 vs. 2.1
  cm; p = 0.001), present with advanced TNM stage (36% vs. 19%; p =
  0.008), and have persistent/recurrent disease (10% vs. 1%; p = 0.006).
  BRAF-positive status was associated with PTC that were tall cell variant
  (p < 0.001), had extrathyroidal extension (p < 0.001), lymph node
  involvement (p = 0.008), advanced (III/IV) TNM stage (p < 0.001), and
  disease recurrence (p < 0.001). Except for lymph node involvement, the
  association between aggressive histology characteristics at presentation
  and BRAF-positive PTC also was observed within the age-defined cohorts.
  In short-term follow-up (mean, 18 months), persistent/recurrent PTC was
  much more likely to occur in patients who were both BRAF-positive and
  elderly (22%).BRAF mutations are equally present in younger and older
  patients. Aggressive histology characteristics at presentation are
  associated with BRAF-positive PTC, irrespective of age. However, the
  well-established association of BRAF with recurrence is limited to older
  (age ≥65 years) patients.

Abstract:
  This study was designed to examine the aggressive features of BRAF-
  positive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and association with age.We
  compared the clinicopathologic parameters and BRAF V600E mutation status
  of 121 elderly (age ≥65 years) PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy
  from January 2007 to December 2009 to a consecutive cohort of 98 younger
  (age <65 years) PTC patients.Younger and elderly PTC patients had
  similar incidences of BRAF-positive tumors (41% vs. 38%; p = 0.67). The
  elderly cohort was more likely to have smaller tumors (mean 1.6 vs. 2.1
  cm; p = 0.001), present with advanced TNM stage (36% vs. 19%; p =
  0.008), and have persistent/recurrent disease (10% vs. 1%; p = 0.006).
  BRAF-positive status was associated with PTC that were tall cell variant
  (p < 0.001), had extrathyroidal extension (p < 0.001), lymph node
  involvement (p = 0.008), advanced (III/IV) TNM stage (p < 0.001), and
  disease recurrence (p < 0.001). Except for lymph node involvement, the
  association between aggressive histology characteristics at presentation
  and BRAF-positive PTC also was observed within the age-defined cohorts.
  In short-term follow-up (mean, 18 months), persistent/recurrent PTC was
  much more likely to occur in patients who were both BRAF-positive and
  elderly (22%).BRAF mutations are equally present in younger and older
  patients. Aggressive histology characteristics at presentation are
  associated with BRAF-positive PTC, irrespective of age. However, the
  well-established association of BRAF with recurrence is limited to older
  (age ≥65 years) patients.

Abstract:
  In multiple myeloma, there has been little progress in the specific
  therapeutic targeting of oncogenic mutations. Whole-genome sequencing
  data have recently revealed that a subset of patients carry an
  activating mutation (V600E) in the BRAF kinase. To uncover the clinical
  relevance of this mutation in multiple myeloma, we correlated the
  mutation status in primary tumor samples from 379 patients with myeloma
  with disease outcome. We found a significantly higher incidence of
  extramedullary disease and a shorter overall survival in mutation
  carriers when compared with controls. Most importantly, we report on a
  patient with confirmed BRAF V600E mutation and relapsed myeloma with
  extensive extramedullary disease, refractory to all approved therapeutic
  options, who has rapidly and durably responded to low doses of the
  mutation-specific BRAF inhibitor vermurafenib. Collectively, we provide
  evidence for the development of the BRAF V600E mutation in the context
  of clonal evolution and describe the prognostic and therapeutic
  relevance of this targetable mutation.

Abstract:
  Melanoma is a disease characterized by lesions that activate ERK.
  Although 70% of cutaneous melanomas harbor activating mutations in the
  BRAF and NRAS genes, the alterations that drive tumor progression in the
  remaining 30% are largely undefined. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor
  of RAF kinases, has clinical utility restricted to BRAF-mutant tumors.
  MEK inhibitors, which have shown clinical activity in NRAS-mutant
  melanoma, may be effective in other ERK pathway-dependent settings.
  Here, we investigated a panel of melanoma cell lines wild type for BRAF
  and NRAS to determine the genetic alteration driving their
  transformation and their dependence on ERK signaling in order to
  elucidate a candidate set for MEK inhibitor treatment. A cohort of the
  BRAF/RAS wild type cell lines with high levels of RAS-GTP had loss of
  NF1, a RAS GTPase activating protein. In these cell lines, the MEK
  inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but also relieved
  feedback inhibition of RAS, resulting in induction of pMEK and a rapid
  rebound in ERK signaling. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor trametinib
  impaired the adaptive response of cells to ERK inhibition, leading to
  sustained suppression of ERK signaling and significant antitumor
  effects. Notably, alterations in NF1 frequently co-occurred with RAS and
  BRAF alterations in melanoma. In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss
  abrogated negative feedback on RAS activation, resulting in elevated
  activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF, but not MEK, inhibitors. We
  conclude that loss of NF1 is common in cutaneous melanoma and is
  associated with RAS activation, MEK-dependence, and resistance to RAF
  inhibition.

Abstract:
  The kinase pathway comprising RAS, RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is
  activated in most human tumours, often through gain-of-function
  mutations of RAS and RAF family members. Using small-molecule inhibitors
  of MEK and an integrated genetic and pharmacologic analysis, we find
  that mutation of BRAF is associated with enhanced and selective
  sensitivity to MEK inhibition when compared to either 'wild-type' cells
  or cells harbouring a RAS mutation. This MEK dependency was observed in
  BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage, and correlated with both
  downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and the induction of G1
  arrest. Pharmacological MEK inhibition completely abrogated tumour
  growth in BRAF mutant xenografts, whereas RAS mutant tumours were only
  partially inhibited. These data suggest an exquisite dependency on MEK
  activity in BRAF mutant tumours, and offer a rational therapeutic
  strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype.

Abstract:
  The identification of somatic mutations in the gene encoding the serine-
  threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) in the majority of melanomas
  offers an opportunity to test oncogene-targeted therapy for this
  disease.We conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of
  PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor of mutated
  BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the maximum dose that
  could be administered without adverse effects (the recommended phase 2
  dose). Patients received PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease
  progression. Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments
  were conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy was
  performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF inhibition.A
  total of 55 patients (49 of whom had melanoma) were enrolled in the
  dose-escalation phase, and 32 additional patients with metastatic
  melanoma who had BRAF with the V600E mutation were enrolled in the
  extension phase. The recommended phase 2 dose was 960 mg twice daily,
  with increases in the dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash, fatigue, and
  arthralgia. In the dose-escalation cohort, among the 16 patients with
  melanoma whose tumors carried the V600E BRAF mutation and who were
  receiving 240 mg or more of PLX4032 twice daily, 10 had a partial
  response and 1 had a complete response. Among the 32 patients in the
  extension cohort, 24 had a partial response and 2 had a complete
  response. The estimated median progression-free survival among all
  patients was more than 7 months.Treatment of metastatic melanoma with
  PLX4032 in patients with tumors that carry the V600E BRAF mutation
  resulted in complete or partial tumor regression in the majority of
  patients. (Funded by Plexxikon and Roche Pharmaceuticals.)

Abstract:
  Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (also known as
  BRAF) are found in 50-70% of malignant melanomas. Pre-clinical studies
  have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency
  on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in
  melanoma-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF
  and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials. However, clinical responses to
  targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or
  acquired resistance. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner
  that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective
  long-term treatment strategies. Here we expressed ∼600 kinase and
  kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate
  resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8
  (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives
  resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates
  ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF
  signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo
  resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance
  in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following
  treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial
  MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible
  therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this
  setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance
  mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative
  approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the
  development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
  Disseminated melanoma is highly therapy resistant. The finding that 66%
  of melanomas harbor the activating BRAF(V600E) mutation has raised
  expectations for targeting the Ras/RAF/mitogen-activated protein
  (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK
  pathway in melanoma. This study addresses the anti-melanoma activity of
  the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886).We recently have shown that
  growing melanoma cells as three-dimensional collagen-implanted spheroids
  enhances resistance to the MEK inhibitor U0126. Here, we investigated
  the anti-melanoma activity of AZD6244 in two-dimensional cell culture,
  the three-dimensional spheroid model, and an in vivo model.In two-
  dimensional cell culture, AZD6244 was cytostatic and reduced the growth
  of melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent fashion through the
  induction of G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. In our three-dimensional
  spheroid model, the effects of AZD6244 were largely cytostatic and
  reversible, with drug washout leading to spheroid regrowth. Finally,
  1205Lu cells were grown as tumor xenografts in severe combined
  immunodeficient mice. After tumor establishment, mice were dosed twice
  daily with 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg AZD6244 p.o. AZD6244 treatment decreased
  phospho-ERK in the tumors and significantly suppressed tumor growth. The
  original tumors remained viable, suggesting that AZD6244 monotherapy was
  largely cytostatic, and not proapoptotic in this model. Further studies
  showed that co-administration of AZD6244 (30 mg/kg) with docetaxel (15
  mg/kg) led to tumor regression, indicating the potential for MEK
  inhibitor/chemotherapy drug combinations.Inhibition of MEK is cytostatic
  as a monotherapy in melanoma, but cytotoxic when combined with
  docetaxel.

Abstract:
  BRAF V600E mutation is seen in 5% to 8% of patients with metastatic
  colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis.
  Vemurafenib, an oral BRAF V600 inhibitor, has pronounced activity in
  patients with metastatic melanoma, but its activity in patients with
  BRAF V600E-positive metastatic CRC was unknown.In this multi-
  institutional, open-label study, patients with metastatic CRC with BRAF
  V600 mutations were recruited to an expansion cohort at the previously
  determined maximum-tolerated dose of 960 mg orally twice a day.Twenty-
  one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 had received at least one prior
  metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Grade 3 toxicities included
  keratoacanthomas, rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. Of the 21 patients
  treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to
  24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria.
  Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent
  mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation
  status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not
  associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations,
  concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency
  in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and
  were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive
  patient-derived xenograft models.In marked contrast to the results seen
  in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib
  did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E
  mutant CRC. Combination strategies are now under development and may be
  informed by the presence of intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS and NRAS
  mutations.

Abstract:
  The usual paradigm for developing kinase inhibitors in oncology is to
  use a high-affinity proof-of-concept inhibitor with acceptable metabolic
  properties for key target validation experiments. This approach requires
  substantial medicinal chemistry and can be confounded by drug toxicity
  and off-target activities of the test molecule. As a better alternative,
  we have developed inducible short-hairpin RNA xenograft models to
  examine the in vivo efficacy of inhibiting oncogenic BRAF. Our results
  show that tumor regression resulting from BRAF suppression is inducible,
  reversible, and tightly regulated in these models. Analysis of
  regressing tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for BRAF to be
  increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. In a metastatic
  melanoma model, conditional BRAF suppression slowed systemic tumor
  growth as determined by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Taken together,
  gain-of-function BRAF signaling is strongly associated with in vivo
  tumorigenicity, confirming BRAF as an important target for small-
  molecule and RNA interference-based therapeutics.

Abstract:
  Activating B-RAF(V600E) (also known as BRAF) kinase mutations occur in
  ∼7% of human malignancies and ∼60% of melanomas. Early clinical
  experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032,
  demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among
  patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug
  resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for
  mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary
  mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of
  alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to
  PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB)
  upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through
  secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines
  artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and
  validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched,
  short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ
  RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature
  of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines,
  patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated
  tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with
  PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another
  subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to
  significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown
  of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant
  subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032
  resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK
  reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape
  B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but
  via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative
  survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK
  pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple
  underlying causative genetic mutations. The B-type Raf proto-oncogene
  (BRAF) plays an important role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling cascade during CRC. The presence of BRAFV600E mutation
  can determine the response of a tumor to chemotherapy. However, the
  association between the BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological
  features of CRC remains controversial. We performed a systematic review
  and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on the
  clinicopathological characteristics of CRC.We identified studies that
  examined the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on CRC within the PubMed, ISI
  Science Citation Index, and Embase databases. The effect of BRAFV600E on
  outcome parameters was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
  confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using a fixed effects or
  random effects model.25 studies with a total of 11,955 CRC patients met
  inclusion criteria. The rate of BRAFV600 was 10.8% (1288/11955). The
  BRAFV600E mutation in CRC was associated with advanced TNM stage, poor
  differentiation, mucinous histology, microsatellite instability (MSI),
  CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This mutation was also
  associated with female gender, older age, proximal colon, and mutL
  homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation.This meta-analysis demonstrated that
  BRAFV600E mutation was significantly correlated with adverse
  pathological features of CRC and distinct clinical characteristics.
  These data suggest that BRAFV600E mutation could be used to supplement
  standard clinical and pathological staging for the better management of
  individual CRC patients, and could be considered as a poor prognostic
  marker for CRC.

Abstract:
  Neuroendocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies
  with a broad spectrum of clinical behavior. Poorly differentiated tumors
  follow an aggressive course with limited treatment options, and new
  approaches are needed. Oncogenic BRAF V600E (BRAF(V600E)) substitutions
  are observed primarily in melanoma, colon cancer, and non-small cell
  lung cancer, but have been identified in multiple tumor types. Here, we
  describe the first reported recurrent BRAF(V600E) mutations in advanced
  high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and identify a BRAF
  alteration frequency of 9% in 108 cases. Among these BRAF alterations,
  80% were BRAF(V600E) Dramatic response to BRAF-MEK combination therapy
  occurred in two cases of metastatic high-grade rectal neuroendocrine
  carcinoma refractory to standard therapy. Urinary BRAF(V600E)
  circulating tumor DNA monitoring paralleled disease response. Our series
  represents the largest study of genomic profiling in colorectal
  neuroendocrine tumors and provides strong evidence that BRAF(V600E) is
  an oncogenic driver responsive to BRAF-MEK combination therapy in this
  molecular subset.BRAF(V600E) is an established oncogenic driver, but
  significant disparities in response exist among tumor types. Two
  patients with treatment-refractory high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine
  tumors harboring BRAF(V600E) exhibited rapid and durable response to
  combined BRAF-MEK inhibition, providing the first clinical evidence of
  efficacy in this aggressive tumor type. Cancer Discov; 6(6); 594-600.

Abstract:
  In the BRIM-3 trial, vemurafenib was associated with risk reduction
  versus dacarbazine of both death and progression in patients with
  advanced BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma. We present an extended
  follow-up analysis of the total population and in the BRAF(V600E) and
  BRAF(V600K) mutation subgroups.Patients older than 18 years, with
  treatment-naive metastatic melanoma and whose tumour tissue was positive
  for BRAF(V600) mutations were eligible. Patients also had to have a life
  expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
  (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological,
  hepatic, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned by
  interactive voice recognition system to receive either vemurafenib (960
  mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) of body surface area
  intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary endpoints were overall survival
  and progression-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat
  population (n=675), with data censored at crossover. A sensitivity
  analysis was done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
  NCT01006980.675 eligible patients were enrolled from 104 centres in 12
  countries between Jan 4, 2010, and Dec 16, 2010. 337 patients were
  randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and 338 to receive dacarbazine.
  Median follow-up was 12·5 months (IQR 7·7-16·0) on vemurafenib and 9·5
  months (3·1-14·7) on dacarbazine. 83 (25%) of the 338 patients initially
  randomly assigned to dacarbazine crossed over from dacarbazine to
  vemurafenib. Median overall survival was significantly longer in the
  vemurafenib group than in the dacarbazine group (13·6 months [95% CI
  12·0-15·2] vs 9·7 months [7·9-12·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI
  0·57-0·87]; p=0·0008), as was median progression-free survival (6·9
  months [95% CI 6·1-7·0] vs 1·6 months [1·6-2·1]; HR 0·38 [95% CI
  0·32-0·46]; p<0·0001). For the 598 (91%) patients with BRAF(V600E)
  disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib group was 13·3
  months (95% CI 11·9-14·9) compared with 10·0 months (8·0-14·0) in the

Abstract:
  Approximately 50% of melanomas harbor activating (V600) mutations in the
  serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF). The oral BRAF inhibitor
  vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients
  with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and
  improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial.We designed a multicenter
  phase 2 trial of vemurafenib in patients with previously treated BRAF
  V600-mutant metastatic melanoma to investigate the efficacy of
  vemurafenib with respect to overall response rate (percentage of treated
  patients with a tumor response), duration of response, and overall
  survival. The primary end point was the overall response rate as
  ascertained by the independent review committee; overall survival was a
  secondary end point.A total of 132 patients had a median follow-up of
  12.9 months (range, 0.6 to 20.1). The confirmed overall response rate
  was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 62; 6% with a complete
  response and 47% with a partial response), the median duration of
  response was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.6), and the median
  progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.1). Primary
  progression was observed in only 14% of patients. Some patients had a
  response after receiving vemurafenib for more than 6 months. The median
  overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 18.3). The most common
  adverse events were grade 1 or 2 arthralgia, rash, photosensitivity,
  fatigue, and alopecia. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas (the majority,
  keratoacanthoma type) were diagnosed in 26% of patients.Vemurafenib
  induces clinical responses in more than half of patients with previously
  treated BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma. In this study with a long
  follow-up, the median overall survival was approximately 16 months.

Abstract:
  We examined the therapeutic potential of a novel MEK inhibitor, RDEA119,
  and its synergism with the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, in thyroid
  cancer cell lines. RDEA119 potently inhibited the proliferation of the 4
  cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation but had no or modest effects on
  the other 4 cells that harbored wild-type BRAF (IC(50) of 0.034-0.217 μM
  vs. 1.413-34.120 μM). This inhibitory effect of RDEA119 in selected cell
  lines OCUT1 (BRAF V600E(+), PIK3CA H1047R(+)) and SW1376 (BRAF V600E(+))
  was enhanced by combination with the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus. The
  PTEN-deficient cell FTC133 was highly sensitive to temsirolimus but
  insensitive to RDEA119, and simultaneous treatment with the latter
  enhanced the sensitivity of the cell to the former. The KAT18 (wild-
  type) cell was not sensitive to either drug alone but became sensitive
  to the combination of the 2 drugs. The drug synergy was confirmed by
  combination index and isobologram analyses. RDEA119 and temsirolimus
  also showed synergistic effects on autophagic death of OCUT1 and KAT18
  cells selectively tested. Dramatic synergistic effects of the 2 drugs
  were also seen on the growth of FTC133 xenograft tumors in nude mice.
  Overall, the effects of the 2 drugs on cell proliferation or autophagic
  death, either alone or in combination, were more pronounced in cells
  that harbored genetic alterations in the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt
  pathways. Thus, these results demonstrated the important therapeutic
  potential of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and its synergism with
  temsirolimus in thyroid cancer.

Abstract:
  BRAF V600E is the genetic lesion underlying hairy-cell leukemia. We
  assessed the safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib
  in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment
  with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine
  analogues.We conducted two phase 2, single-group, multicenter studies of
  vemurafenib (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily)--one in Italy and one in
  the United States. The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks
  in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U.S. study. Primary end points
  were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall
  response rate (in the U.S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28
  patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36
  planned patients) in the U.S. trial.The overall response rates were 96%
  (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in
  the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the
  U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% (9 of 26 patients)
  and 42% (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian
  trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free
  survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6
  months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free
  survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U.S. trial,
  at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73% and the overall
  survival rate was 91%. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade
  1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were
  rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated
  with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent
  persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow
  at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a
  resistance mechanism.A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly
  effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

Abstract:
  In vitro, EGFR inhibition, combined with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib,
  causes synergistic cytotoxicity for BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal
  cancer, further augmented by irinotecan. The safety and efficacy of
  vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab in BRAF-mutated malignancies are
  not defined. In this 3+3 phase I study, patients with BRAFV600E-advanced
  solid cancers received cetuximab and irinotecan with escalating doses of
  vemurafenib. Nineteen patients (18 with metastatic colorectal cancer and
  1 with appendiceal cancer) were enrolled. Three patients experienced
  dose-limiting toxicities. The MTD of vemurafenib was 960 mg twice daily.
  Six of 17 evaluable patients (35%) achieved a radiographic response by
  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, consistent
  with in vivo models demonstrating tumor regressions with the triplet
  regimen. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months. BRAFV600E
  circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) trends correlated with radiographic
  changes, and acquired mutations from cfDNA in genes reactivating MAPK
  signaling were observed at progression.Vemurafenib, in combination with
  irinotecan and cetuximab, was well tolerated in patients with
  refractory, BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, and both survival
  outcomes and response rates exceeded prior reports for vemurafenib and
  for irinotecan plus cetuximab in BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal cancer.
  In vivo models demonstrated regressions with the triplet, in contrast
  with vemurafenib and cetuximab alone. cfDNA predicted radiographic
  response and identified mutations reactivating the MAPK pathway upon
  progression. Cancer Discov; 6(12); 1352-65. ©2016 AACR.This article is

Abstract:
  PURPOSE Cetuximab or panitumumab are effective in 10% to 20% unselected
  metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. KRAS mutations account for
  approximately 30% to 40% patients who are not responsive. The serine-
  threonine kinase BRAF is the principal effector of KRAS. We hypothesized
  that, in KRAS wild-type patients, BRAF mutations could have a
  predictive/prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively
  analyzed objective tumor responses, time to progression, overall
  survival (OS), and the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in 113 tumors
  from cetuximab- or panitumumab-treated metastatic CRC patients. The
  effect of the BRAF V600E mutation on cetuximab or panitumumab response
  was also assessed using cellular models of CRC. Results KRAS mutations
  were present in 30% of the patients and were associated with resistance
  to cetuximab or panitumumab (P = .011). The BRAF V600E mutation was
  detected in 11 of 79 patients who had wild-type KRAS. None of the BRAF-
  mutated patients responded to treatment, whereas none of the responders
  carried BRAF mutations (P = .029). BRAF-mutated patients had
  significantly shorter progression-free survival (P = .011) and OS (P <
  .0001) than wild-type patients. In CRC cells, the introduction of BRAF
  V600E allele impaired the therapeutic effect of cetuximab or
  panitumumab. Treatment with the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib restored
  sensitivity to panitumumab or cetuximab of CRC cells carrying the V600E
  allele. CONCLUSION BRAF wild-type is required for response to
  panitumumab or cetuximab and could be used to select patients who are
  eligible for the treatment. Double-hit therapies aimed at simultaneous
  inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and BRAF warrant
  exploration in CRC patients carrying the V600E oncogenic mutation.

Abstract:
  BRAF V600 mutations occur in various nonmelanoma cancers. We undertook a
  histology-independent phase 2 "basket" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600
  mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers.We enrolled patients in six
  prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were
  enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600
  mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with
  colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary
  end point was the response rate; secondary end points included
  progression-free and overall survival.In the cohort with non-small-cell
  lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20
  to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5
  to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell
  histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median
  treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients
  had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses
  among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid
  cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and
  clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who
  received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior
  studies of vemurafenib for melanoma.BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable
  oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary
  vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in
  Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The
  histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF
  V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech;

Abstract:
  Approximately 45% of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with
  wild-type KRAS exon 2 are resistant to cetuximab treatment. We set out
  to identify additional genetic markers that might predict the response
  to cetuximab treatment. Fifty-three wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC patients
  were treated with cetuximab/irinotecan-based chemotherapy as a first- or
  third-line therapy. The mutational statuses of 10 EGFR pathway genes
  were analyzed in primary tumors using next-generation sequencing. BRAF,
  PIK3CA, KRAS (exons 3 and 4), NRAS, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations were
  detected in 6, 6, 5, 4, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. Four of the BRAF
  mutations were non-V600 variants. Four tumors harbored multiple co-
  existing (complex) mutations. All patients with BRAF mutations or
  complex mutation patterns were cetuximab non-responders. All patients
  but one harboring KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutations were non-responders.
  Mutations in any one of these three genes were associated with a poor
  response rate (7.1%) and reduced survival (PFS = 8.0 months) compared to
  wild-type patients (74.4% and 11.6 months). Our data suggest that KRAS,
  NRAS, and BRAF mutations predict response to cetuximab treatment in mCRC
  patients.

Abstract:
  Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (also known as
  BRAF) are found in 50-70% of malignant melanomas. Pre-clinical studies
  have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency
  on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in
  melanoma-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF
  and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials. However, clinical responses to
  targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or
  acquired resistance. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner
  that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective
  long-term treatment strategies. Here we expressed ∼600 kinase and
  kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate
  resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8
  (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives
  resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates
  ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF
  signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo
  resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance
  in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following
  treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial
  MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible
  therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this
  setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance
  mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative
  approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the
  development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
  BRAF(V600E/K) is a frequent mutationally active tumor-specific kinase in
  melanomas that is currently targeted for therapy by the specific
  inhibitor PLX4032. Our studies with melanoma tumor cells that are
  BRAF(V600E/K) and BRAF(WT) showed that, paradoxically, while PLX4032
  inhibited ERK1/2 in the highly sensitive BRAF(V600E/K), it activated the
  pathway in the resistant BRAF(WT) cells, via RAF1 activation, regardless
  of the status of mutations in NRAS or PTEN. The persistently active
  ERK1/2 triggered downstream effectors in BRAF(WT) melanoma cells and
  induced changes in the expression of a wide-spectrum of genes associated
  with cell cycle control. Furthermore, PLX4032 increased the rate of
  proliferation of growth factor-dependent NRAS Q61L mutant primary
  melanoma cells, reduced cell adherence and increased mobility of cells
  from advanced lesions. The results suggest that the drug can confer an
  advantage to BRAF(WT) primary and metastatic tumor cells in vivo and
  provide markers for monitoring clinical responses.

Abstract:
  Background: The NCI-MATCH precision medicine trial assigns patients
  (pts) with solid tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma with progression
  on prior treatment to a targeted therapy based on genetic alterations
  identified in pre-treatment biopsies. Arm H (EAY131-H) evaluated the
  combination of the BRAF inhibitor (inh) dabrafenib (DAB), and the MEK
  inh, trametinib (TRM), in pts with BRAF V600E/K mutations. Methods: Pts
  with melanoma, thyroid, or colorectal cancer were excluded. Pts with
  NSCLC were excluded after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  approved DAB/TRM for this indication. Pts received DAB 150 mg po BID and
  TRM 2 mg PO daily on 28 day cycles until disease progression or
  intolerable toxicity; restaging was performed every 2 cycles. The
  primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints
  included progression-free survival (PFS), 6-month PFS, and overall
  survival (OS). Results: A total of 35 pts were enrolled from
  1/2016-2/2018; 2 were ineligible (CrCl below criteria; labs out of
  window). Over 17 distinct tumor histologies were represented. 58% of pts
  were female, median age was 63 (range 21-85), 94% were Caucasian, and
  48% of pts had received at least 3 prior therapies (range 1- 8). The
  confirmed ORR was 33.3% (90% CI 19.9%, 49.1%), with a median duration of
  response (DoR) of 12 months (mon). Varied histologies had a DoR of > 12
  mon: histiocytic sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma and mixed
  adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary, among others. Median
  PFS was 9.4 mon; the 6 mon PFS rate was 70.6% (90% CI 58.2%-85.5%), and
  an additional 10 pts had a PFS > 5.5 mon. Median OS has not been
  reached. At the time of data cutoff (12/2018) 11 pts continue on
  treatment. Adverse events (AE) were comparable to previously reported
  profiles of DAB/TRM; no new AEs were identified. The most frequent grade
  3 AEs were fatigue, neutropenia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and
  urinary tract infection; there was 1 grade 4 sepsis; no grade 5 AEs.
  Conclusions: In this pre-treated, mixed histology cohort, DAB and TRM
  showed promising activity outside of currently approved FDA indications
  warranting further investigations. Correlative analyses are planned.

Abstract:
  The usual paradigm for developing kinase inhibitors in oncology is to
  use a high-affinity proof-of-concept inhibitor with acceptable metabolic
  properties for key target validation experiments. This approach requires
  substantial medicinal chemistry and can be confounded by drug toxicity
  and off-target activities of the test molecule. As a better alternative,
  we have developed inducible short-hairpin RNA xenograft models to
  examine the in vivo efficacy of inhibiting oncogenic BRAF. Our results
  show that tumor regression resulting from BRAF suppression is inducible,
  reversible, and tightly regulated in these models. Analysis of
  regressing tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for BRAF to be
  increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. In a metastatic
  melanoma model, conditional BRAF suppression slowed systemic tumor
  growth as determined by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Taken together,
  gain-of-function BRAF signaling is strongly associated with in vivo
  tumorigenicity, confirming BRAF as an important target for small-
  molecule and RNA interference-based therapeutics.

Abstract:
  Multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms have been described,
  however, their relative frequency, clinical correlates, and effect on
  subsequent therapy have not been assessed in patients with metastatic
  melanoma.Fifty-nine BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma metastases from patients
  treated with dabrafenib or vemurafenib were analyzed. The genetic
  profile of resistance mechanisms and tumor signaling pathway activity
  was correlated with clinicopathologic features and therapeutic
  outcomes.Resistance mechanisms were identified in 58% progressing tumors
  and BRAF alterations were common. Gene expression analysis revealed that
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity remained inhibited in
  21% of resistant tumors, and the outcomes of patients with these tumors
  were poor. Resistance mechanisms also occurred in pretreatment biopsies
  and heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms occurred within patients and
  within tumors. There were no responses to subsequent targeted therapy,
  even when a progressing tumor had a resistance mechanism predicted to be
  responsive.Selecting sequential drugs based on the molecular
  characteristics of a single progressing biopsy is unlikely to provide
  improved responses, and first-line therapies targeting multiple pathways
  will be required.

Abstract:
  BRAF(V600E) is the most frequent oncogenic protein kinase mutation
  known. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting "active" protein kinases have
  demonstrated significant utility in the therapeutic repertoire against
  cancer. Therefore, we pursued the development of specific kinase
  inhibitors targeting B-Raf, and the V600E allele in particular. By using
  a structure-guided discovery approach, a potent and selective inhibitor
  of active B-Raf has been discovered. PLX4720, a 7-azaindole derivative
  that inhibits B-Raf(V600E) with an IC(50) of 13 nM, defines a class of
  kinase inhibitor with marked selectivity in both biochemical and
  cellular assays. PLX4720 preferentially inhibits the active B-Raf(V600E)
  kinase compared with a broad spectrum of other kinases, and potent
  cytotoxic effects are also exclusive to cells bearing the V600E allele.
  Consistent with the high degree of selectivity, ERK phosphorylation is
  potently inhibited by PLX4720 in B-Raf(V600E)-bearing tumor cell lines
  but not in cells lacking oncogenic B-Raf. In melanoma models, PLX4720
  induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis exclusively in
  B-Raf(V600E)-positive cells. In B-Raf(V600E)-dependent tumor xenograft
  models, orally dosed PLX4720 causes significant tumor growth delays,
  including tumor regressions, without evidence of toxicity. The work
  described here represents the entire discovery process, from initial
  identification through structural and biological studies in animal
  models to a promising therapeutic for testing in cancer patients bearing
  B-Raf(V600E)-driven tumors.

Abstract:
  BRAF G469A is a missense mutation within exon 11 of the BRAF gene
  resulting in a constitutively activated enzyme frequently associated
  with MAP kinase cascade signaling activation. No evidence currently
  exists about its role in determining sensitivity/resistance to BRAF
  inhibitors, utilized in the treatment of patients carrying BRAF V600
  mutations, and to chemotherapy. The newly established metastatic
  melanoma (MM) cell line MO-1 was characterized for its sensitivity to
  vemurafenib and nab-paclitaxel, both already utilized for the treatment
  of MM.All analyses were carried out by comparing results with those
  found in MM cells wild type for BRAF or mutated in V600. In addition,
  cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and
  flow cytometry.The exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell
  proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in
  vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this
  sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of
  MITF. Nab-paclitaxel strongly reduced proliferation of MO-1 cells
  perhaps for the very low expression level of PMEL17, transcriptionally
  regulated by MITF and negatively involved in determining sensitivity to
  taxanes.Thus, the mutation BRAF G469A in MM might be related to a weak
  effectiveness of therapy with BRAF inhibitors and a promising
  therapeutic approach may be with nab-paclitaxel.

Abstract:
  The effects of the BRAF(V600E) mutation on prognostic factors and poor
  clinical outcomes in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have not been fully
  quantified. The authors performed comprehensive meta-analysis to assess
  the strength of associations between these conditions and the
  BRAF(V600E) mutation.The authors identified the clinical studies that
  examined the association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in surgical
  specimens with clinicopathologic outcomes between January 2003 and
  October 2010 using the Medline database. One hundred thirty-one relevant
  studies were hand-searched. The authors selected 27 studies that
  included 5655 PTC patients. They calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs)
  or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using
  a random effect model.The average prevalence rate of the BRAF(V600E)
  mutation was 49.4%. In 26 studies, compared with the patients who had
  the wild-type BRAF genes, the PTC patients with the BRAF(V600E) mutation
  had increased ORs of an extrathyroidal invasion (OR, 2.14; 95% CI,
  1.68-2.73), a lymph node metastasis (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.97), and
  an advanced TNM stage (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.61-2.49). In 8 studies,
  patients with the mutation had 2.14-fold increased risk of recurrent and
  persistent disease (95% CI, 1.67-2.74). The associations were generally
  consistent across the different study populations.This meta-analysis
  demonstrates that the BRAF(V600E) mutation is closely related to the
  high-risk clinicopathological factors and poorer outcome of PTC. The
  results obtained here suggest that the BRAF(V600E) mutation should be
  considered as a poor prognostic marker in PTC and may lead to better
  management for individual patients.

Abstract:
  The BRAF(V600E) mutation is common in several human cancers, especially
  melanoma. RG7204 (PLX4032) is a small-molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E)
  kinase activity that is in phase II and phase III clinical testing.
  Here, we report a preclinical characterization of the antitumor activity
  of RG7204 using established in vitro and in vivo models of malignant
  melanoma. RG7204 potently inhibited proliferation and mitogen-activated
  protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and ERK
  phosphorylation in a panel of tumor cell lines, including melanoma cell
  lines expressing BRAF(V600E) or other mutant BRAF proteins altered at
  codon 600. In contrast, RG7204 lacked activity in cell lines that
  express wild-type BRAF or non-V600 mutations. In several tumor xenograft
  models of BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanoma, we found that RG7204
  treatment caused partial or complete tumor regressions and improved
  animal survival, in a dose-dependent manner. There was no toxicity
  observed in any dose group in any of the in vivo models tested. Our
  findings offer evidence of the potent antitumor activity of RG7204
  against melanomas harboring the mutant BRAF(V600E) gene.

Abstract:
  PLX4032/vemurafenib is a first-in-class small-molecule BRAF(V600E)
  inhibitor with clinical activity in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.
  Nevertheless, drug resistance develops in treated patients, and
  strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance are required. To
  explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to
  PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling
  in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell
  lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and
  independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma
  such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines
  lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic
  alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with
  the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and
  ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-
  regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK
  signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent
  probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-
  TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC
  signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and
  CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or
  siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing
  cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification;
  similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell
  line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance
  to PLX4032. Our results support the development of classification of
  melanoma in molecular subtypes for more effective therapies.

Abstract:
  Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently
  been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-
  damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line
  with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in
  melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell
  viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib,
  nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in
  nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of
  the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10
  nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation
  induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib
  (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib
  (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients
  with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one
  patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked
  reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose
  (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after
  dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect
  of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in
  melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous,
  chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.

Abstract:
  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative
  disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia. Recent identification of
  the recurrent V600E BRAF mutation in a majority of HCL patients has led
  some teams to evaluate the clinical potential of vemurafenib, a BRAF
  V600 specific inhibitor in a limited number of refractory HCL patients.
  Recently, we published the case of an HCL patient successfully treated
  with a low dose of vemurafenib. Eight months after the ending of
  treatment this patient relapsed. We present here the successful
  retreatment of this patient with a second line of vemurafenib. Our data
  suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a
  day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission
  after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240
  mg) daily without inducing major toxicity.

  harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.To determine the efficacy and safety
  of vemurafenib when used outside of a clinical trial.A retrospective
  review at MD Anderson Cancer Center.The best responses were evaluated
  using RECIST v1.1. A single radiologist reviewed all images. Adverse
  events (AEs) were evaluated using CTCAE v.4.0.We identified 17 patients
  with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation who were treated
  with vemurafenib outside of a clinical trial. Median age at diagnosis
  was 63 years, and 53% were male. At vemurafenib start, 3 (18%) patients
  had disease confined to the neck, and 14 (72%) had distant metastases.
  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors had been previously administered to 4 (24%)
  patients. Two (12%) patients discontinued vemurafenib because of AEs
  before restaging. Best response: partial response (PR) in 7/15 (47%) and
  stable disease (SD) in 8/15(53%) patients. The rate of durable response
  (PR plus SD ≥ 6 months) was 67%. Median time to treatment failure was 13
  months. There was no association between change in thyroglobulin and
  tumor size. Drug discontinuation, drug interruptions, and dose
  reductions were needed in 5 (29%), 13 (76%), and 10 (59%) patients,
  respectively. Most common AEs were fatigue (71%), weight loss (71%),
  anorexia (65%), arthralgias (59%), hair loss (59%), rash (59%), hand-
  foot syndrome (53%), calluses (47%), diarrhea (47%), fever (41%), dry
  mouth (35%), nausea (35%), and verrucous keratosis (35%). Grade ≥ 3 AEs
  were present in 8 (47%) patients.Vemurafenib is a potentially effective
  and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced PTC
  harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Our results are similar to those
  reported in a phase II clinical trial and support the potential role of
  vemurafenib in this patient population.

Abstract:
  Clinical benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic papillary
  thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is disappointing, and effective therapeutic
  approaches for these patients are urgently needed. Because kinase-
  activating mutations in the BRAF proto-oncogene commonly occur in
  advanced PTC, and inhibition of BRAF(V600E) has shown promising clinical
  activity in melanoma, BRAF inhibitor therapy may be an effective
  strategy to treat metastatic PTC.The dose escalation portion of a first-
  in-human, phase I study of vemurafenib, a selective RAF inhibitor,
  included three patients with metastatic PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E)
  mutation. Vemurafenib was initially dosed at 240-360 mg twice a day,
  later escalated to 720 mg twice a day. Response evaluation was performed
  every 8 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
  (RECIST).Among the three patients, one had a confirmed partial response
  with reduction of pulmonary target lesions by 31%, and the duration of
  response was 7.6 months before the disease progressed in the lungs and
  the bones. The time to progression was 11.7 months. The other two
  patients had stable disease, and the time to progression was 13.2 and
  11.4 months, respectively.Vemurafenib appears to have a promising
  clinical activity in patients with metastatic PTC, and our data suggest
  that the BRAF(V600E) mutant kinase is a relevant target for therapy in
  this patient population. Further investigation of inhibitors of mutated
  BRAF kinase in patients with PTC in a phase II study is warranted.

Abstract:
  Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy. Most
  papillary thyroid carcinomas contain BRAF mutations or RET/PTC
  rearrangements, thus providing targets for biologic therapy. Our
  previous studies had suggested papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with
  a BRAF mutation and the RET/PTC1 rearrangement have different
  sensitivities to MEK1/2 inhibitors, suggesting different signaling
  transduction pathways were involved.Src signaling transduction pathway
  in PTC cells was examined using Src inhibitors (PP2, SU6656, or
  dasatinib) and si-Src RNA in vitro by Western blot analysis and
  proliferation analysis. An orthotopic xenograft mouse model was used for
  the in vivo studies using dasatinib.In PTC cells, Src inhibitors
  suppressed p-Src and p-FAK and inhibited cell growth. In addition,
  significant suppression and extension of the p-ERK1/2 dephosphorylation
  were detected in RET/PTC1-rearranged cells in combination with an MEK
  inhibitor (CI-1040). The Src family kinase/ABL inhibitor, dasatinib,
  significantly decreased tumor volume in mice inoculated with PTC cells
  carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement. In BRAF-mutated PTC cells, Src
  inhibitors effectively suppressed p-Src expression and dasatinib
  significantly decreased tumor volume with twice daily treatment.Src
  inhibitors effectively inhibited the Src signaling transduction pathway
  in PTC cells in vitro and dasatinib suppressed tumor growth in vivo.
  These results suggested that Src signaling transduction pathway plays an
  important role in regulating growth in PTC cells. Combination of Src and
  MEK1/2 inhibitors extended the dephosphorylation of extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in PTCs carrying the RET/PTC1
  rearrangement suggesting that combination therapy with complementary
  inhibitors of other signaling transduction pathways may be needed to
  effectively suppress growth and induce apoptosis in these cells.

Abstract:
  Interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells plays an important
  role in the growth and metastasis of colon cancer. We previously found
  that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressed platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β) and that PDGFR targeted therapy using
  imatinib or nilotinib inhibited stromal reaction. Bone marrow-derived
  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) migrate to tumor stroma and differentiate
  into CAFs. A novel oral multikinase inhibitor regorafenib inhibits
  receptor tyrosine kinases expressed on stromal cells (vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3, TIE2, PDGFR-β, and fibroblast
  growth factors) and tumor cells (c-KIT, RET, and BRAF). These molecules
  are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and
  stromal activation. Therefore, we examined whether regorafenib impaired
  the tumor-promoting effect of CAFs/MSCs. KM12SM human colon cancer cells
  alone or KM12SM cells with MSCs were transplanted into the cecal wall of
  nude mice. Co-implantation of KM12SM cells with MSCs into the cecal wall
  of nude mice produced tumors with abundant stromal component and
  promoted tumor growth and lymph node metastasis. Single treatment with
  regorafenib inhibited tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting both
  tumor cells and stromal reaction. This tumor-inhibitory effect of
  regorafenib was more obvious in tumors developed by co-implanting KM12SM
  cells with MSCs. Our data suggested that targeting of the tumor
  microenvironment with regorafenib affected tumor cell-MSC interaction,
  which in turn inhibited the growth and metastasis of colon cancer.

Abstract:
  Approximately 2% of lung adenocarcinomas have BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog B) mutations, including V600E and other types.
  Vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and sorafenib as BRAF inhibitors are currently
  tested in clinical trials, but access for patients is limited. The aim
  of this study was to document the clinical course of patients treated
  outside of clinical trials.We conducted a retrospective multicenter
  cohort study in Europe of patients with advanced BRAF-mutant lung cancer
  treated with known BRAF inhibitors. Data were anonymized and centrally
  assessed for age, gender, smoking, histology, stage, local molecular
  diagnostic results, systemic therapies, and survival. Best response was
  assessed locally by RECIST1.1.We documented 35 patients treated in 17
  centers with vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or sorafenib. Median age was 63
  years (range 42-85); gender was balanced; 14 (40%) were never smokers;
  all (100%) had adenocarcinoma; 29 (83%) had V600E; 6 (17%) had other
  mutations; one of them had a concomitant KRAS mutation. Thirty (86%)
  patients had chemotherapy in the first line. Overall survival with
  first-line therapy was 25.3 months for V600E and 11.8 months for
  non-V600E. Thirty-one patients received one BRAF inhibitor, and four
  received a second inhibitor. Overall response rate with BRAF therapy was
  53%, and disease control rate was 85%. Median progression-free survival
  with BRAF therapy was 5.0 months, and overall survival was 10.8
  months.These results confirm the activity of targeted therapy in
  patients with BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Further trials are
  warranted to study combination therapies and drug resistance mechanisms.

Abstract:
  We address the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF
  mutations for clinical outcomes in response to active agents in the
  treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We determined KRAS,
  BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in tumours from 168 patients treated for mCRC
  at two institutions. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line
  chemotherapy and treatment outcome was analysed retrospectively.KRAS,
  BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 62 (37%), 13 (8%) and 26 (15%)
  cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis uncovered BRAF mutation as an
  independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazard ratio (HR)
  4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.6). In addition, patients with
  BRAF-mutant tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival
  (PFS: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4) than those whose tumors that carried wild-
  type BRAF. Among 92 patients treated using chemotherapy and cetuximab as
  salvage therapy, KRAS mutation was associated with lack of response
  (P=0.002) and shorter PFS (P=0.09). BRAF (P=0.0005) and PIK3CA (P=0.01)
  mutations also predicted reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage
  therapy.These results underscore the potential of mutational profiling
  to identify CRCs with different natural histories or treatment
  responses. The adverse significance of BRAF mutation should inform
  patient selection and stratification in clinical trials.

Abstract:
  Somatic BRAF mutations have been reported in 1-4% of non-small cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC), primarily in adenocarcinomas with the BRAF (V600E)
  mutation in about 50% of the cases. The role of BRAF mutation in NSCLC
  and the treatment for tumors with such mutations is still evolving. Our
  patient had metastatic NSCLC with metastases to her brain. Due to the
  BRAF (V600E) mutation in her tumor and her poor functional status, we
  offered her off-label treatment with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor
  approved for use in metastatic melanoma. Our patient's visceral disease
  improved supporting vemurafenib's efficacy in the treatment of
  metastatic BRAF-mutated NSCLC. The regression of intracranial disease
  indicated vemurafenib was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and was
  efficacious in treating brain metastases in this patient with lung
  cancer.

Abstract:
  BRAF (V600E) mutation is the most commonly detected genetic alteration
  in thyroid cancer. Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF
  inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in
  thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to
  investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment
  response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted
  therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms
  and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid
  cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the
  effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer
  cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary
  thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug
  sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the
  changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to
  PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on
  orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells
  presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due
  to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT,
  and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor
  (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were
  confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-
  mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway
  contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant
  anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032. Dual inhibition of BRAF and
  c-Met leads to sustained treatment response. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract:
  No effective systemic treatment exists for malignant peripheral nerve
  sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors have been reported to show
  increased activity in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway from
  the loss of neurofibromatosis-1 regulation and occasionally from BRAF
  V600E mutation. A patient with sporadic metastatic MPNST and the BRAF
  V600E mutation was treated with standard doses of sorafenib and later
  vemurafenib and followed for response. The patient showed a rapid but
  modest and transient response to sorafenib and a very dramatic response
  to vemurafenib. This case represents the first report of successful
  systemic treatment of MPNST with an inhibitor of the BRAF V600E
  mutation. It will be important to define the general utility of this
  approach and related therapies in this disease.

Abstract:
  Conjunctival malignant melanoma (CMM) is a rare malignancy and in the
  advanced setting there is no effective treatment. In contrast, half of
  cutaneous melanomas have BRAF mutations and treatment with BRAF
  inhibitors is established for patients with disseminated disease. The
  most common form of ocular melanoma, uveal melanoma, lacks these
  mutations, however, their presence has been reported for CMM.We used the
  BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib to treat a 53 year-old female suffering from
  a BRAF(V600E) mutated metastatic CMM. The patient benefited from the
  treatment, a response was evident within a week and she experienced a
  progression free survival of four months.To our knowledge, this is the
  first described case of response to vemurafenib treatment in a patient
  with ocular melanoma.

Abstract:
  Since the prognosis of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains poor
  with traditional chemotherapy, attention has shifted to molecularly
  targeted agents. Results of available clinical studies reveal little or
  no benefit of using targeted agents in advanced CCA. Limitations of
  these trials could be the lack of comprehensive molecular and genetic
  characterization of CCA samples in order to identify potential drug
  targets. Here we report a case of a 59-year-old female with
  chemotherapy-refractor, metastatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  (EHCCA). After failure of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin plus
  gemcitabine, next generation sequencing (NGS) based tumor molecular
  profiling was performed on aspiration cytological sample, that revealed
  BRAF V600E mutation. Multidisciplinary team decided on the initiation of
  combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Dabrafenib was started
  orally 150 mg twice a day, adding trametinib 2 mg once a day. Right from
  the initiation of targeted therapy, significant clinical improvement had
  been observed. Even though the first restaging computed tomography (CT)
  scan at 8 weeks revealed spectacular decrease in all metastatic sites, a
  new hepatic mass of 67 mm × 40 mm was identified and interpreted as new
  metastatic lesion. As the clinical and radiological response was
  contradictory, CT-guided biopsy was taken from the hepatic lesion while
  the therapy was continued on. Histopathologic evaluation excluded the
  hepatic lesion from being a metastasis, instead described it as a
  fibrotic, inflammatory lesion. At 12 week, PET CT confirmed further
  tumor regression with complete regression of the multiple cerebral
  metastases. The therapy has been extremely well tolerated by the
  patient. According to our knowledge, this is the first reported case on
  a successful treatment of EHCCA with the combination of dabrafenib and
  trametinib. Our case highlights the importance of molecular profiling in
  CCA, in order to find potential actionable driver mutations for
  personalised treatment.

Abstract:
  Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) typically presents at an advanced
  stage and is associated with a poor oncological outcome. The median
  survival for metastatic ICC is less than 1 year with standard
  chemotherapy. ICC is associated with distinct oncogenic drivers
  including IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase), HER-2 (human epidermal growth
  factor 2), and BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B),
  which may benefit from matching targeted therapies. Hereby we report 2
  cases of BRAF V600E refractory ICC treated with dual BRAF and MEK
  inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib) with excellent clinical and
  radiological response to therapy and with protracted duration of disease
  control. Our first patient achieved CR (complete remission) at 6 months
  of treatment with ultimate disease progression at 9 months. The second
  patient achieved a PR (partial response) at 2 months from starting
  treatment and remains progression free at 5 months. Our results confirm
  the activity of dual BRAF and MEK targeting in BRAF mutated ICC, adding
  further support to 3 additional case-reports in the literature. Dual
  targeting appears superior to other case reports with BRAF inhibition
  alone and appear favorable to historic data with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
  Given the poor outlook and refractoriness of BRAF mutant ICC, future
  studies should focus on early integration of BRAF/MEK inhibition.

Abstract:
  Purpose Detection of specific molecular alterations in tumors guides the
  selection of effective targeted treatment of patients with several types
  of cancer. These molecular alterations may occur in other tumor types
  for which the efficacy of targeted therapy remains unclear. The
  MyPathway study evaluates the efficacy and safety of selected targeted
  therapies in tumor types that harbor relevant genetic alterations but
  are outside of current labeling for these treatments. Methods MyPathway
  ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141) is a multicenter,
  nonrandomized, phase IIa multiple basket study. Patients with advanced
  refractory solid tumors harboring molecular alterations in human
  epidermal growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor,
  v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, or the Hedgehog pathway
  are treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or
  vismodegib, respectively. The primary end point is investigator-assessed
  objective response rate within each tumor-pathway cohort. Results
  Between April 1, 2014 and November 1, 2016, 251 patients with 35
  different tumor types received study treatment. The efficacy population
  contains 230 treated patients who were evaluated for response or
  discontinued treatment before evaluation. Fifty-two patients (23%) with
  14 different tumor types had objective responses (complete, n = 4;
  partial, n = 48). Tumor-pathway cohorts with notable objective response
  rates included human epidermal growth factor
  receptor-2-amplified/overexpressing colorectal (38% [14 of 37]; 95% CI,
  23% to 55%) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1
  V600-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (43% [six of 14]; 95% CI, 18% to
  71%). Conclusion The four currently approved targeted therapy regimens
  in the MyPathway study produced meaningful responses when administered
  without chemotherapy in several refractory solid tumor types not
  currently labeled for these agents.

Abstract:
  Although BRAF inhibitor monotherapy yields response rates >50% in
  BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, only approximately 5% of patients with
  BRAFV600E colorectal cancer respond. Preclinical studies suggest that
  the lack of efficacy in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer is due to adaptive
  feedback reactivation of MAPK signaling, often mediated by EGFR. This
  clinical trial evaluated BRAF and EGFR inhibition with dabrafenib (D) +
  panitumumab (P) ± MEK inhibition with trametinib (T) to achieve greater
  MAPK suppression and improved efficacy in 142 patients with BRAFV600E
  colorectal cancer. Confirmed response rates for D+P, D+T+P, and T+P were
  10%, 21%, and 0%, respectively. Pharmacodynamic analysis of paired
  pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies found that efficacy of D+T+P
  correlated with increased MAPK suppression. Serial cell-free DNA
  analysis revealed additional correlates of response and emergence of
  KRAS and NRAS mutations on disease progression. Thus, targeting adaptive
  feedback pathways in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer can improve efficacy,
  but MAPK reactivation remains an important primary and acquired
  resistance mechanism.Significance: This trial demonstrates that combined
  BRAF + EGFR + MEK inhibition is tolerable, with promising activity in
  patients with BRAFV600E colorectal cancer. Our findings highlight the
  MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer and the
  need to optimize strategies inhibiting this pathway to overcome both
  primary and acquired resistance. Cancer Discov; 8(4); 428-43. ©2018

Abstract:
  We address the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF
  mutations for clinical outcomes in response to active agents in the
  treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We determined KRAS,
  BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in tumours from 168 patients treated for mCRC
  at two institutions. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line
  chemotherapy and treatment outcome was analysed retrospectively.KRAS,
  BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 62 (37%), 13 (8%) and 26 (15%)
  cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis uncovered BRAF mutation as an
  independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazard ratio (HR)
  4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.6). In addition, patients with
  BRAF-mutant tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival
  (PFS: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4) than those whose tumors that carried wild-
  type BRAF. Among 92 patients treated using chemotherapy and cetuximab as
  salvage therapy, KRAS mutation was associated with lack of response
  (P=0.002) and shorter PFS (P=0.09). BRAF (P=0.0005) and PIK3CA (P=0.01)
  mutations also predicted reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage
  therapy.These results underscore the potential of mutational profiling
  to identify CRCs with different natural histories or treatment
  responses. The adverse significance of BRAF mutation should inform
  patient selection and stratification in clinical trials.

Abstract:
  To investigate the prognostic value of the BRAF V600E mutation and the
  recently identified TERT promoter mutation chr5:1,295,228C>T (C228T),
  individually and in their coexistence, in papillary thyroid cancer
  (PTC).We performed a retrospective study of the relationship of BRAF and
  TERT C228T mutations with clinicopathologic outcomes of PTC in 507
  patients (365 women and 142 men) age 45.9 ± 14.0 years (mean ± SD) with
  a median follow-up of 24 months (interquartile range, 8 to 78
  months).Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT C228T mutations were more
  commonly associated with high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics of
  PTC than they were individually. Tumor recurrence rates were 25.8% (50
  of 194;77.60 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 58.81 to
  102.38) versus 9.6% (30 of 313; 22.88 recurrences per 1,000 person-
  years; 95% CI, 16.00 to 32.72) in BRAF mutation-positive versus
  -negative patients (hazard ratio [HR], 3.22; 95% CI, 2.05 to 5.07) and
  47.5% (29 of 61; 108.55 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI,
  75.43 to 156.20) versus 11.4% (51 of 446; 30.21 recurrences per 1,000
  person-years; 95% CI, 22.96 to 39.74) in TERT mutation-positive versus
  -negative patients (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.19 to 5.45). Recurrence rates
  were 68.6% (24 of 35; 211.76 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI,
  141.94 to 315.94) versus 8.7% (25 of 287; 21.60 recurrences per 1,000
  person-years; 95% CI, 14.59 to 31.97) in patients harboring both
  mutations versus patients harboring neither mutation (HR, 8.51; 95% CI,
  4.84 to 14.97), which remained significant after clinicopathologic
  cofactor adjustments. Disease-free patient survival curves displayed a
  moderate decline with BRAF V600E or TERT C228T alone but a sharp decline
  with two coexisting mutations.Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT C228T
  mutations form a novel genetic background that defines PTC with the
  worst clinicopathologic outcomes, providing unique prognostic and
  therapeutic implications.

Abstract:
  BRAF(V600E) is the most frequent genetic mutation in papillary thyroid
  cancer (PTC) and has been reported as an independent predictor of poor
  prognosis of these patients. Current guidelines do not recommend the use
  of BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis on cytologic specimens from fine
  needle aspiration due to several reasons. Recently, immunohistochemistry
  using VE1, a mouse anti-human BRAF(V600E) antibody, has been reported as
  a highly reliable technique in detecting BRAF-mutated thyroid and
  nonthyroid cancers. The aim of this study was to test the reliability of
  VE1 immunohistochemistry on microhistologic samples from core needle
  biopsy (CNB) in identifying BRAF-mutated PTC. A series of 30 nodules
  (size ranging from 7 to 22 mm) from 30 patients who underwent surgery
  following CNB were included in the study. All these lesions had had
  inconclusive cytology. In all cases, both VE1 and BRAF(V600E) genotypes
  were evaluated. After surgery, final histology demonstrated 21 cancers
  and 9 benign lesions. CNB correctly diagnosed 20/20 PTC and 5/5
  adenomatous nodules. One follicular thyroid cancer and 4 benign lesions
  were assessed at CNB as uncertain follicular neoplasm. VE1
  immunohistochemistry revealed 8 mutated PTC and 22 negative cases. A
  100% agreement was found when positive and negative VE1 results were
  compared with BRAF mutational status. These data are the first
  demonstration that VE1 immunohistochemistry performed on thyroid CNB
  samples perfectly matches with genetic analysis of BRAF status. Thus,
  VE1 antibody can be used on thyroid microhistologic specimens to detect
  BRAF(V600E)-mutated PTC before surgery.

Abstract:
  Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, as compared with BRAF inhibition
  alone, delays the emergence of resistance and reduces toxic effects in
  patients who have melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.In this
  phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 423 previously untreated patients
  who had unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a BRAF V600E
  or V600K mutation to receive a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally
  twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or dabrafenib and
  placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary
  end points included overall survival, response rate, response duration,
  and safety. A preplanned interim overall survival analysis was
  conducted.The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months in the
  dabrafenib-trametinib group and 8.8 months in the dabrafenib-only group
  (hazard ratio for progression or death in the dabrafenib-trametinib
  group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.99; P=0.03). The
  overall response rate was 67% in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 51%
  in the dabrafenib-only group (P=0.002). At 6 months, the interim overall
  survival rate was 93% with dabrafenib-trametinib and 85% with dabrafenib
  alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.94; P=0.02).
  However, a specified efficacy-stopping boundary (two-sided P=0.00028)
  was not crossed. Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups,
  although more dose modifications occurred in the dabrafenib-trametinib
  group. The rate of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was lower in the
  dabrafenib-trametinib group than in the dabrafenib-only group (2% vs.
  9%), whereas pyrexia occurred in more patients (51% vs. 28%) and was
  more often severe (grade 3, 6% vs. 2%) in the dabrafenib-trametinib
  group.A combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, as compared with
  dabrafenib alone, improved the rate of progression-free survival in
  previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma with BRAF
  V600E or V600K mutations. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline; Clinical

Abstract:
  Background: BRAFV600E mutation is present in a subset of pediatric brain
  tumors. Vemurafenib is an oral, selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of
  BRAFV600E kinase. The goal of this multi-center study conducted through
  the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) was to determine
  the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)
  in children < 18 years with recurrent or progressive BRAFV600E mutant
  brain tumors. Results: Nineteen eligible patients were enrolled. Eleven
  patients had received three or more prior therapies. Data reported are
  from the start of treatment for the first patient (April 30 2014)
  through August 31 2019. The RP2D was defined as 550 mg/m2 twice daily
  after DLT criteria adjustment for rash. Related grade ≥ 3 adverse events
  included secondary keratoacanthoma (n = 1); rash (n =16); and fever (n =
  5). Subjects received a median of 23 cycles (range 3-63). Four patients
  remain on treatment. Centrally reviewed best radiographic responses
  included 1 complete response, 5 partial responses, and 13 stable
  disease. The steady-state area under the curve (AUC0-∞median) was 604
  mg*h/L (range 329-1052). Methods: Vemurafenib was given starting at 550
  mg/m2, twice daily which corresponds to the adult RP2D. Adverse events
  were graded using the NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
  (CTCAE) version 4.0. Central imaging review was performed.
  Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed. Conclusions: Vemurafenib has
  promising anti-tumor activity in recurrent BRAF V600E-positive brain
  tumors with manageable toxicity. A phase 2 study is ongoing
  (NCT01748149).

Abstract:
  Mutations within the KRAS proto-oncogene have predictive value but are
  of uncertain prognostic value in the treatment of advanced colorectal
  cancer. We took advantage of PETACC-3, an adjuvant trial with 3,278
  patients with stage II to III colon cancer, to evaluate the prognostic
  value of KRAS and BRAF tumor mutation status in this setting.Formalin-
  fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (n = 1,564) were prospectively
  collected and DNA was extracted from tissue sections from 1,404 cases.
  Planned analysis of KRAS exon 2 and BRAF exon 15 mutations was performed
  by allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survival
  analyses were based on univariate and multivariate proportional hazard
  regression models.KRAS and BRAF tumor mutation rates were 37.0% and
  7.9%, respectively, and were not significantly different according to
  tumor stage. In a multivariate analysis containing stage, tumor site,
  nodal status, sex, age, grade, and microsatellite instability (MSI)
  status, KRAS mutation was associated with grade (P = .0016), while BRAF
  mutation was significantly associated with female sex (P = .017), and
  highly significantly associated with right-sided tumors, older age, high
  grade, and MSI-high tumors (all P < 10(-4)). In univariate and
  multivariate analysis, KRAS mutations did not have a major prognostic
  value regarding relapse-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS).
  BRAF mutation was not prognostic for RFS, but was for OS, particularly
  in patients with MSI-low (MSI-L) and stable (MSI-S) tumors (hazard
  ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.4; P = .0003).In stage II-III colon cancer,
  the KRAS mutation status does not have major prognostic value. BRAF is
  prognostic for OS in MS-L/S tumors.

Abstract:
  Background: BRAF mutations are present in ~44% of papillary thyroid
  carcinoma (PTC) and its role in development of PTC is well established.
  We hypothesized that dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) would have efficacy in
  BRAF mutated PTC and that combining it with trametinib (MEK inhibitor)
  would result in greater clinical efficacy than dabrafenib alone, through
  vertical inhibition of the RAF/MAP/ERK pathway and mitigation of
  potential mechanisms of resistance. Methods: Patients (pts) with BRAF
  mutated radioiodine refractory PTC who had evidence of disease
  progression within 13 months prior were randomized to Arm A (dabrafenib
  150 mg PO BID) or Arm B (dabrafenib 150 mg PO BID + trametinib 2 mg PO
  qd). Cross-over to Arm B was allowed at time of progression. Responses
  were assessed by modified RECISTv1.1 every 2 months. Primary endpoint
  was objective response rate (ORR) (complete-, partial- and minor-
  response). With assumed true ORR of 15% vs 35%; and 90% power to
  identify the correct regimen as most promising, 26 pts were to be
  accrued in each Arm. Results: In this randomized phase 2 trial, 53 pts
  (median age 63 years, 38 females) were enrolled; 25% of pts had 1-3
  prior therapy with multi-kinase inhibitors. Median follow up was 13
  months. Preliminary efficacy results are outlined in Table. The
  treatment-related adverse events were similar to previously reported
  phase III clinical trial of these drugs in melanoma. Conclusions: Single
  agent dabrafenib, as well as combination of dabrafenib/trametinib are
  well tolerated therapies that result in similar high objective response
  rates with durable responses in pts with progressive BRAF-mutated PTC.
  BRAF-pathway targeted therapies provide novel treatment options.

Abstract:
  BRAFV600 mutations are commonly found in melanoma and thyroid cancers
  and to a lesser degree in other tumor types. Subprotocol H (EAY131-H) of
  the NCI-MATCH platform trial sought to investigate the selective BRAF
  inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib in patients
  with solid tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma whose tumors harbored
  a BRAFV600 mutation.EAY131-H is an open-label, single-arm study.
  Patients with melanoma, thyroid, or colorectal cancer were excluded;
  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were later excluded in an
  amendment. Patients received dabrafenib 150 mg twice per day and
  trametinib 2 mg per day continuously until disease progression or
  intolerable toxicity. The primary end point was centrally assessed
  objective response rate (ORR); secondary end points included
  progression-free survival (PFS), 6-month PFS, and overall
  survival.Thirty-five patients were enrolled, and 29 were included in the
  primary efficacy analysis as prespecified in the protocol. Median age
  was 59 years, and 45% of the patients had received ≥ 3 lines of therapy.
  The confirmed ORR was 38% (90% CI, 22.9% to 54.9%) with P < .0001
  against a null rate of 5%, and PFS was 11.4 months (90% CI, 8.4 to 16.3
  months); responses were seen in 7 distinct tumor types. Seven patients
  had a duration of response of > 12 months, including 4 patients with a
  duration of response of > 24 months. An additional 8 patients had a PFS
  > 6 months. The median overall survival was 28.6 months. Reported
  adverse events were comparable to those noted in previously reported
  profiles of dabrafenib and trametinib.This study met its primary end
  point, with an ORR of 38% (P < .0001) in this mixed histology,
  pretreated cohort. This promising activity warrants additional
  investigations in BRAFV600-mutated tumors outside of currently approved
  indications.

Description:
  This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various
  colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the
  cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three
  harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing
  cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between
  0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines
  expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib
  treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular
  proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the
  three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that
  one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO)
  harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic
  mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced
  substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose
  tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95%
  tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle
  treated controls).

Abstract:
  The protein kinase BRAF is a key component of the RAS-RAF signaling
  pathway which plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and survival. Mutations in BRAF at codon 600 promote
  catalytic activity and are associated with 8% of all human (solid)
  tumors, including 8% to 10% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Here, we report
  the preclinical characterization of vemurafenib (RG7204; PLX4032;
  RO5185426), a first-in-class, specific small molecule inhibitor of
  BRAF(V600E) in BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines and tumor xenograft models.
  As a single agent, vemurafenib shows dose-dependent inhibition of ERK
  and MEK phosphorylation, thereby arresting cell proliferation in
  BRAF(V600)-expressing cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in
  BRAF(V600E) bearing xenograft models. Because vemurafenib has shown
  limited single-agent clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-mutant metastatic
  CRC, we therefore explored a range of combination therapies, with both
  standard agents and targeted inhibitors in preclinical xenograft models.
  In a BRAF-mutant CRC xenograft model with de novo resistance to
  vemurafenib (RKO), tumor growth inhibition by vemurafenib was enhanced
  by combining with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). The addition of
  vemurafenib to capecitabine and/or bevacizumab, cetuximab and/or
  irinotecan, or erlotinib resulted in increased antitumor activity and
  improved survival in xenograft models. Together, our findings suggest
  that the administration of vemurafenib in combination with standard-of-
  care or novel targeted therapies may lead to enhanced and sustained
  clinical antitumor efficacy in CRCs harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.

Abstract:
  Identifying rectal cancer patients at risk for local recurrence would
  allow for refinement in the selection of patients who would benefit from
  preoperative radiotherapy. PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations are commonly
  found in colon cancers, but their prevalence has not been clearly
  assessed in rectal cancer. In this study, we aim to determine the
  mutation frequencies of PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF and to investigate
  whether a mutation may be used as a prognostic parameter in rectal
  cancer patients.We evaluated DNA mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF in
  240 stage I to III rectal tumors obtained from nonirradiated patients
  from the Dutch Total Mesorectal Excision trial.PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF
  mutations were identified in 19 (7.9%), 81 (33.9%), and 5 (2.1%) rectal
  cancers. Patients with PIK3CA mutations developed more local recurrences
  (5-year risks, 27.8% versus 9.4%; P = 0.006) and tended to develop these
  recurrences more rapidly after surgery (median local recurrence-free
  interval since surgery: 7.9 versus 19.6 months; P = 0.07) than patients
  without PIK3CA mutations. In multivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations
  remained as an independent predictor for the development of local
  recurrences (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.2; P =
  0.017), next to tumor-node-metastasis stage.PIK3CA mutations can be used
  as a biomarker in identifying rectal cancer patients with an increased
  risk for local recurrences. Currently, our findings suggest that
  prospective evaluation of PIK3CA mutation status could reduce
  overtreatment by preoperative radiotherapy for the low-risk patients who
  might otherwise only experience the side effects.

Abstract:
  The identification of somatic mutations in the gene encoding the serine-
  threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) in the majority of melanomas
  offers an opportunity to test oncogene-targeted therapy for this
  disease.We conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of
  PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor of mutated
  BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the maximum dose that
  could be administered without adverse effects (the recommended phase 2
  dose). Patients received PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease
  progression. Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments
  were conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy was
  performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF inhibition.A
  total of 55 patients (49 of whom had melanoma) were enrolled in the
  dose-escalation phase, and 32 additional patients with metastatic
  melanoma who had BRAF with the V600E mutation were enrolled in the
  extension phase. The recommended phase 2 dose was 960 mg twice daily,
  with increases in the dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash, fatigue, and
  arthralgia. In the dose-escalation cohort, among the 16 patients with
  melanoma whose tumors carried the V600E BRAF mutation and who were
  receiving 240 mg or more of PLX4032 twice daily, 10 had a partial
  response and 1 had a complete response. Among the 32 patients in the
  extension cohort, 24 had a partial response and 2 had a complete
  response. The estimated median progression-free survival among all
  patients was more than 7 months.Treatment of metastatic melanoma with
  PLX4032 in patients with tumors that carry the V600E BRAF mutation
  resulted in complete or partial tumor regression in the majority of
  patients. (Funded by Plexxikon and Roche Pharmaceuticals.)

Abstract:
  Kinase inhibitors targeting the BRAF V600 mutation have become standard
  in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Albeit in wide clinical use,
  the patterns associated with therapy outcome are not fully elucidated.
  The present study was aimed to identify predictive factors of therapy
  response and survival under the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.This
  multicenter retrospective study analyzed patient, tumor, and
  pretreatment characteristics collected in BRAF V600-mutated stage IV
  melanoma patients before single-agent therapy with the BRAF inhibitor
  vemurafenib.A total of 300 patients from 14 centers were included into
  this study with a median follow-up time of 13.0 months. Median
  progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months; median overall survival
  (OS) was 7.6 months. Best response under vemurafenib was associated with
  serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; ≤ versus >upper normal limit; P =
  0.0000001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) overall
  performance status (OPS) (0 versus ≥ 1; P = 0.00089), and BRAF mutation
  subtype (V600E versus V600K; P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis
  identified ECOG OPS ≥ 1 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.88; P = 0.00005],
  immunotherapy pretreatment (HR = 0.53; P = 0.0067), elevated serum LDH
  (HR = 1.45; P = 0.012), age >55 years (HR = 0.72; P = 0.019), and
  chemotherapy pretreatment (HR = 1.39; P = 0.036) as independent
  predictors of PFS. For OS, elevated serum LDH (HR = 1.99; P = 0.00012),
  ECOG OPS ≥ 1 (HR = 1.90; P = 0.00063), age >55 years (HR = 0.65; P =
  0.011), kinase inhibitor pretreatment (HR = 1.86; P = 0.014),
  immunotherapy pretreatment (HR = 0.57; P = 0.025), chemotherapy
  pretreatment (HR = 2.17; P = 0.039), and male gender (HR = 0.70; 95%
  confidence interval 0.50-0.98; P = 0.039) were found as predictors.Our
  data demonstrate that the type of pretreatment strongly influences the
  outcome of vemurafenib therapy, with a precedent immunotherapy showing a
  positive, and a prior chemotherapy and kinase inhibitors showing a
  negative impact on survival, respectively. Moreover, we show that the
  patient's OPS, serum LDH, age, and gender independently impact
  vemurafenib therapy outcome. These findings should be taken into account
  for the future design of therapy sequencing in BRAF V600 mutation-
  positive melanoma patients.

Abstract:
  Low-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas (LGSOC) make up approximately
  10 % of serous ovarian carcinomas. While rarely aggressive, this slow-
  growing tumor is well known to respond poorly to chemotherapy. Specific
  treatments for this ovarian subtype are lacking, with the same global
  approaches used for high grade cases being applied for LGSOC patients.
  LGSOCs have been reported to have a specific genetic profile, with
  notable implication of the MAPK pathway. This has opened up
  opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies, with in particular the
  use of targeted therapies. We report here the case of a heavily
  pretreated unresectable BRAF p.V600E-mutated LGSOC, which we treated
  vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor specific for V600E mutations. We saw
  impressive efficacy, with a long-term partial response along with CA125
  reductions and symptom relief. Although this mutation is present in
  LGSOC at very a low incidence, we recommend routine testing for BRAF and
  other targetable mutations in this patient population, along with
  further evaluation in the increasingly popular basket trial approach.

Abstract:
  Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) consist of a number of entities with
  overlapping histological features. PLGGs have much better prognosis than
  the adult counterparts, but a significant proportion of PLGGs suffers
  from tumor progression and recurrence. It has been shown that pediatric
  and adult low-grade gliomas are molecularly distinct. Yet the clinical
  significance of some of newer biomarkers discovered by genomic studies
  has not been fully investigated. In this study, we evaluated in a large
  cohort of 289 PLGGs a list of biomarkers and examined their clinical
  relevance. TERT promoter (TERTp), H3F3A and BRAF V600E mutations were
  detected by direct sequencing. ATRX nuclear loss was examined by
  immunohistochemistry. CDKN2A deletion, KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, and MYB
  amplification were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization
  (FISH). TERTp, H3F3A, and BRAF V600E mutations were identified in 2.5,
  6.4, and 7.4% of PLGGs, respectively. ATRX loss was found in 4.9% of
  PLGGs. CDKN2A deletion, KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and MYB amplification were
  detected in 8.8, 32.0 and 10.6% of PLGGs, respectively. Survival
  analysis revealed that TERTp mutation, H3F3A mutation, and ATRX loss
  were significantly associated with poor PFS (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and
  p = 0.0002) and OS (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001). BRAF V600E
  was associated with shorter PFS (p = 0.011) and OS (p = 0.032) in a
  subset of PLGGs. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was a good prognostic marker for
  longer PFS (p = 0.0017) and OS (p = 0.0029). MYB amplification was also
  a favorable marker for a longer PFS (p = 0.040). Importantly, we showed
  that these molecular biomarkers can be used to stratify PLGGs into low-
  (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or MYB amplification), intermediate-I (BRAF V600E
  and/or CDKN2A deletion), intermediate-II (no biomarker), and high-risk
  (TERTp or H3F3A mutation or ATRX loss) groups with distinct PFS (p <
  0.0001) and OS (p < 0.0001). This scheme should aid in clinical
  decision-making.

Abstract:
  Purpose We report the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor)
  and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) combination therapy in BRAF V600E-mutated
  anaplastic thyroid cancer, a rare, aggressive, and highly lethal
  malignancy with poor patient outcomes and no systemic therapies with
  clinical benefit. Methods In this phase II, open-label trial, patients
  with predefined BRAF V600E-mutated malignancies received dabrafenib 150
  mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until unacceptable
  toxicity, disease progression, or death. The primary end point was
  investigator-assessed overall response rate. Secondary end points
  included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall
  survival, and safety. Results Sixteen patients with BRAF V600E-mutated
  anaplastic thyroid cancer were evaluable (median follow-up, 47 weeks;
  range, 4 to 120 weeks). All patients had received prior radiation
  treatment and/or surgery, and six had received prior systemic therapy.
  The confirmed overall response rate was 69% (11 of 16; 95% CI, 41% to
  89%), with seven ongoing responses. Median duration of response,
  progression-free survival, and overall survival were not reached as a
  result of a lack of events, with 12-month estimates of 90%, 79%, and
  80%, respectively. The safety population was composed of 100 patients
  who were enrolled with seven rare tumor histologies. Common adverse
  events were fatigue (38%), pyrexia (37%), and nausea (35%). No new
  safety signals were detected. Conclusion Dabrafenib plus trametinib is
  the first regimen demonstrated to have robust clinical activity in BRAF
  V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and was well tolerated. These
  findings represent a meaningful therapeutic advance for this orphan
  disease.

Abstract:
  BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer represents a significant
  clinical problem, with combination approaches being developed clinically
  with oral BRAF inhibitors combined with EGFR-targeting antibodies. While
  compelling preclinical data have highlighted the effectiveness of
  combination therapy with vemurafenib and small-molecule EGFR inhibitors,
  gefitinib or erlotinib, in colorectal cancer, this therapeutic strategy
  has not been investigated in clinical studies.We conducted a phase Ib/II
  dose-escalation/expansion trial investigating the safety/efficacy of the
  BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitor erlotinib.Thirty-two
  patients with BRAF V600E positive metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
  and 7 patients with other cancers were enrolled. No dose-limiting
  toxicities were observed in escalation, with vemurafenib 960 mg twice
  daily with erlotinib 150 mg daily selected as the recommended phase II
  dose. Among 31 evaluable patients with mCRC and 7 with other cancers,
  overall response rates were 32% [10/31, 16% (5/31) confirmed] and 43%
  (3/7), respectively, with clinical benefit rates of 65% and 100%. Early
  ctDNA dynamics were predictive of treatment efficacy, and serial ctDNA
  monitoring revealed distinct patterns of convergent genomic evolution
  associated with acquired treatment resistance, with frequent emergence
  of MAPK pathway alterations, including polyclonal KRAS, NRAS, and MAP2K1
  mutations, and MET amplification.The Erlotinib and Vemurafenib In
  Combination Trial study demonstrated a safe and novel combination of two
  oral inhibitors targeting BRAF and EGFR. The dynamic assessment of
  serial ctDNA was a useful measure of underlying genomic changes in
  response to this combination and in understanding potential mechanisms
  of resistance.

Abstract:
  BEACON CRC evaluated encorafenib plus cetuximab with or without
  binimetinib versus investigators' choice of irinotecan or FOLFIRI plus
  cetuximab in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer
  (mCRC), after progression on 1-2 prior regimens. In the previously
  reported primary analysis, encorafenib, binimetinib plus cetuximab
  (ENCO/BINI/CETUX; triplet) and encorafenib plus cetuximab (ENCO/CETUX;
  doublet) regimens improved overall survival (OS) and objective response
  rate (ORR; by blinded central review) versus standard of care. The
  purpose of this analysis was to report updated efficacy and safety
  data.In this open-label, phase III trial, 665 patients with BRAF
  V600E-mutant mCRC were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive triplet,
  doublet, or control. Primary end points were OS and independently
  reviewed ORR comparing triplet to control. OS for doublet versus control
  was a key secondary end point. Updated analyses include 6 months of
  additional follow-up and ORR for all randomized patients.Patients
  received triplet (n = 224), doublet (n = 220), or control (n = 221).
  Median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 10.8) for triplet and 5.9
  months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.1) for control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60 [95%
  CI, 0.47 to 0.75]). Median OS for doublet was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.0 to
  11.3) (HR v control, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77]). Confirmed ORR was
  26.8% (95% CI, 21.1% to 33.1%) for triplet, 19.5% (95% CI, 14.5% to
  25.4%) for doublet, and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.5% to 4.6%) for control. Adverse
  events were consistent with the prior primary analysis, with grade ≥ 3
  adverse events in 65.8%, 57.4%, and 64.2% for triplet, doublet, and
  control, respectively.In the BEACON CRC study, encorafenib plus
  cetuximab improved OS, ORR, and progression-free survival in previously
  treated patients in the metastatic setting compared with standard
  chemotherapy. Based on the primary and updated analyses, encorafenib
  plus cetuximab is a new standard care regimen for previously treated
  patients with BRAF V600E mCRC.

Description:
  In an open-label, phase 3 randomized trial, 250 patients with either
  previously untreated, stage IV or unresectable stage III BRAF V600E
  mutation-positive melanoma were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive
  dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily, orally or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2)
  intravenously every 3 weeks. The median progression-free survival was
  5.1 months for dabrafenib and 2.7 months for dacarbazine, with a hazard
  ratio of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.18 – 0.51; p < 0.0001). Treatment-related
  adverse events of grade 2 or greater occurred in 100/187 patients who
  received dabrafenib and in 26/59 patients who received dacarbazine.

Abstract:
  Dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated BRAF, has clinical activity with a
  manageable safety profile in studies of phase 1 and 2 in patients with
  BRAF(V600)-mutated metastatic melanoma. We studied the efficacy of
  dabrafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutated metastatic melanoma.We
  enrolled patients in this open-label phase 3 trial between Dec 23, 2010,
  and Sept 1, 2011. This report is based on a data cutoff date of Dec 19,
  2011. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, stage
  IV or unresectable stage III BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive melanoma were
  randomly assigned (3:1) to receive dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily,
  orally) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks).
  Patients were stratified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer
  stage (unresectable III+IVM1a+IVM1b vs IVM1c). The primary endpoint was
  investigator-assessed progression-free survival and was analysed by
  intention to treat; safety was assessed per protocol. This study is
  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227889.Of the 733
  patients screened, 250 were randomly assigned to receive either
  dabrafenib (187 patients) or dacarbazine (63 patients). Median
  progression-free survival was 5·1 months for dabrafenib and 2·7 months
  for dacarbazine, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·30 (95% CI 0·18-0·51;
  p<0·0001). At data cutoff, 107 (57%) patients in the dabrafenib group
  and 14 (22%) in the dacarbazine group remained on randomised treatment.
  Treatment-related adverse events (grade 2 or higher) occurred in 100
  (53%) of the 187 patients who received dabrafenib and in 26 (44%) of the
  59 patients who received dacarbazine. The most common adverse events
  with dabrafenib were skin-related toxic effects, fever, fatigue,
  arthralgia, and headache. The most common adverse events with
  dacarbazine were nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, fatigue, and asthenia.
  Grade 3-4 adverse events were uncommon in both groups.Dabrafenib
  significantly improved progression-free survival compared with
  dacarbazine.GlaxoSmithKline.

Abstract:
  Inhibition of the BRAF(V600E) oncoprotein by the small-molecule drug
  PLX4032 (vemurafenib) is highly effective in the treatment of melanoma.
  However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic
  lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this
  drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of
  PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-
  interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases
  whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that
  blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong
  synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E)
  mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug
  cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly
  synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo.
  Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid
  feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in
  the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low
  levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback
  activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of
  EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our
  data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10%
  of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted
  treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy
  consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.

Description:
  In this case series, 11 patients with ECD or ECD/LCH (Seven had ECD and
  four had overlapped ECD/LCH) were treated with single-agent dabrafenib
  as initial histiocytosis therapy, following the failure of chemotherapy
  or radiation, or following discontinuation of vemurafenib therapy
  because of toxicity or intolerance were assessed. Dabrafenib monotherapy
  was initially dosed from 50mg BID to 150mg twice daily. FDG-PET/CT scans
  were performed prior to starting dabrafenib and in follow-up to measure
  disease response in nearly all cases. For the five patients treated with
  dabrafenib as initial therapy or following failure of conventional
  therapy, three had a partial metabolic response and two had a complete
  metabolic response by FDG-PET; all had a complete clinical response. In
  three of these six patients, dabrafenib maintained their clinical and
  metabolic response to vemurafenib; the sixth patient had been treated
  with interferon-a with poor clinical response, and dabrafenib achieved a
  sustained clinical and metabolic response. Two patients who stopped
  vemurafenib for arthralgia or fatigue stopped dabrafenib for similar
  intolerance after four and nine months, respectively.

Description:
  In this case series, the authors assessed the efficacy and safety of
  swapping cetuximab for panitumumab as some patients are unable to
  tolerate treatment with the mouse/human chimeric monoclonal IgG1
  antibody cetuximab. Panitumumab is a fully humanized IgG2 anti-EGFR
  antibody that has a different binding site and also has a distinct
  toxicity profile, causing fewer infusion reactions than cetuximab. Case
  one was a 70-year-old female presenting with progressive metastatic
  colorectal cancer after undergoing prior treatment with FOLFOX in 2016
  and 2020 (2020 in combination with bevacizumab). Molecular profiling of
  the patient’s tumour revealed a BRAF V600E mutation (KRAS-, NRAS wild-
  type, MSS). Cetuximab and encorafenib were applied for three cycles
  without any grade III/IV toxicities. However, the fourth infusion of
  cetuximab had to be aborted due to a strong infusion reaction, which had
  to be treated with dimenhydrinate and prednisone. The cetuximab was
  swapped for panitumumab, and except for Grade I-II skin toxicity, no
  panitumumab-related side effects occurred. After 15 months, the patient
  is still stable under combination therapy with encorafenib plus
  panitumumab. Case two is a 67-year-old male presenting for adjuvant
  therapy after resection of rectal cancer. The patient progressed during
  adjuvant treatment with capecitabine. Molecular characterization of the
  malignancy revealed a BRAF V600E mutation (KRAS-, NRAS wild-type, MSS).
  Treatment with FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab was initiated, to which the
  patient initially responded well. Due to progressive disease after about
  10 months, second-line treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab was
  initiated. Under this therapy, the patient developed multiple brain
  metastases which were treated by surgical and radiotherapeutic
  interventions. After switching to encorafenib and cetuximab, the first
  infusion of cetuximab led to a severe allergic reaction with pronounced
  respiratory symptoms. After the switch to panitumumab, no further
  infusion reaction occurred, and besides grade I skin toxicity, no other
  relevant side effects were apparent. The patient achieved a good partial
  remission at three and six months. However, after ten months of
  panitumumab and encorafenib, the patient progressed.

  In this case study, a 32-year-old man, previously fit and well,
  presented with a two-month history of vertigo, right visual disturbance,
  dysphagia, and ataxia. Brain MRI revealed a large mixed solid and cystic
  mass within the upper pons, with heterogeneous enhancement extending
  along the left third cranial nerve root exit. The patient subsequently
  underwent posterior fossa craniotomy and excisional biopsy of the
  brainstem tumour. Histology showed a WHO grade 1 ganglioglioma with a
  pilocytic glial component. After four years from the initial diagnosis,
  MRI surveillance revealed progression in the cystic component of the
  lesion, with worsening neurological symptoms including right sixth nerve
  palsy, tongue fasciculations and right-sided hemi-anesthesia. Testing of
  his initial biopsy specimen demonstrated a BRAF V600E mutation (Sequenom
  OncoFOCUS Panel v3.0). The patient was started on vemurafenib 960 mg
  twice daily and cobimetinib 60 mg daily. Treatment was complicated by a
  grade 2 maculopapular rash and grade 2 ALT elevation and was withheld
  until improvement of toxicities back to grade 1. The patient restarted
  vemurafenib at 720 mg twice daily and cobimetinib at 60 mg daily. At 13
  weeks post-commencement, restaging MRI demonstrated a partial response,
  with a substantial reduction in the solid component of the lesion and a
  lesser reduction in the cystic component. Objective clinical improvement
  with the resolution of tongue fasciculations and subjective improvement
  in sensory abnormalities and diplopia have been observed. At the time of
  publication, the patient was in an ongoing partial response.

Abstract:
  Post-surgical management of low grade gangliogliomas is controversial
  with paucity of data for the use of chemotherapy. BRAF mutations are
  present in a number of glioma subtypes and offer an opportunity for
  treatment with targeted therapy.A 32-year-old man with an unresectable,
  BRAF V600E mutant, WHO grade 1 ganglioglioma is commenced on combination
  BRAF and MEK inhibition (vemurafenib and cobimetinib). Partial
  radiological and clinical response was noted after 13 weeks of
  treatment. Treatment complication with grade 2 skin and liver toxicity
  was resolved with dose interruption and reduction.Combination BRAF and
  MEK inhibition present a safe and feasible treatment strategy in
  unresectable BRAF V600E mutant low grade ganglioglioma.

Description:
  In this case series, two patients with BRAF V600E mutant pleomorphic
  xanthoastrocytoma were treated using the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and
  trametinib in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Patient one
  is a 48-year-old female with progressive anaplastic pleomorphic
  xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). She initially presented with a seizure and
  underwent a craniotomy and resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.
  She remained in remission for 3 years. Subsequent relapses over 2 years
  were treated with three further debulking surgeries, cyst drainage and
  chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimens included six cycles of procarbazine,
  CCNU (lomustine), vincristine; six cycles of temozolomide and three
  cycles of carboplatin. MRI after three cycles of carboplatin showed
  tumour progression. Analysis of archival tumour tissue from an earlier
  surgery identified a BRAF V600E mutation using DNA sequencing.
  Histopathology showed glial tumour cells with significant nuclear
  pleomorphism and abundant eosinophilic glassy cytoplasm, multiple giant
  cells, brisk mitotic activity and necrosis. Immunohistochemistry for
  BRAF V600E was strongly positive, while IDH1R132H was negative, and ATRX
  was retained. The Ki67 proliferation index was 15%. She started
  treatment with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib dosed at 150 mg twice daily
  in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib dosed at 2 mg once
  daily. MRI of the brain at this time showed a decrease in the bulk of
  partially enhancing cystic/necrotic mass with a reduction of mass
  effect. Subsequent interval MRI, 4 months following commencement of
  dabrafenib and trametinib shows continued reduction in the size of both
  solid and cystic disease. At the last review, 8 months following the
  start of treatment, she was well, with a noted improvement in fatigue
  and resolution of headaches. She continues on dabrafenib and trametinib.
  Patient two was a previously treated patient that underwent successful
  for relapsed BRAF V600E mutated anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma
  with dabrafenib, following intolerance to vemurafenib. The patient
  continued dabrafenib for 18 months, at which point she chose to stop
  therapy and commence radiological surveillance. She had no visible
  disease on MRI at this time. She subsequently had radiological
  progression and now is undergoing subsequent treatment with a
  combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib. Two months after
  stopping dabrafenib, the first surveillance MRI demonstrated a new 8 mm
  homogeneously enhancing nodular lesion on the posteromedial aspect of
  the surgical cavity. The patient was re-started on dabrafenib at 150 mg

Abstract:
  BRAFV600E mutations have been identified in a number of glioma subtypes,
  most frequently in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, ganglioglioma,
  pilocytic astrocytoma, and epithelioid glioblastoma. Although the
  development of BRAF inhibitors has dramatically improved the clinical
  outcome for patients with BRAFV600E mutant tumors, resistance develops
  in a majority of patients due to reactivation of the MAPK pathway.
  Addition of MEK inhibition to BRAF inhibition improves survival. Here we
  report successful treatment of two patients with BRAFV600E mutant
  pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma using the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in
  combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib.

Abstract:
  Effective treatments are needed to improve outcomes for high-grade
  glioma and low-grade glioma. The activity and safety of dabrafenib plus
  trametinib were evaluated in adult patients with recurrent or
  progressive BRAFV600E mutation-positive high-grade glioma and low-grade
  glioma.This study is part of an ongoing open-label, single-arm, phase 2
  Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) basket trial at 27 community and
  academic cancer centres in 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada,
  France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea,
  Spain, Sweden, and the USA). The study enrolled patients aged 18 years
  or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
  of 0, 1, or 2. Patients with BRAFV600E mutation-positive high-grade
  glioma and low-grade glioma received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus
  trametinib 2 mg once daily orally until unacceptable toxicity, disease
  progression, or death. In the high-grade glioma cohort, patients were
  required to have measurable disease at baseline using the Response
  Assessment in Neuro-Oncology high-grade glioma response criteria and
  have been treated previously with radiotherapy and first-line
  chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients with low-grade
  glioma were required to have measurable non-enhancing disease (except
  pilocytic astrocytoma) at baseline using the Response Assessment in
  Neuro-Oncology low-grade glioma criteria. The primary endpoint, in the
  evaluable intention-to-treat population, was investigator-assessed
  objective response rate (complete response plus partial response for
  high-grade glioma and complete response plus partial response plus minor
  response for low-grade glioma). This trial is ongoing, but is closed for
  enrolment, NCT02034110.Between April 17, 2014, and July 25, 2018, 45
  patients (31 with glioblastoma) were enrolled into the high-grade glioma
  cohort and 13 patients were enrolled into the low-grade glioma cohort.
  The results presented here are based on interim analysis 16 (data cutoff
  Sept 14, 2020). In the high-grade glioma cohort, median follow-up was
  12·7 months (IQR 5·4-32·3) and 15 (33%; 95% CI 20-49) of 45 patients had
  an objective response by investigator assessment, including three
  complete responses and 12 partial responses. In the low-grade glioma
  cohort, median follow-up was 32·2 months (IQR 25·1-47·8). Nine (69%; 95%
  CI 39-91) of 13 patients had an objective response by investigator
  assessment, including one complete response, six partial responses, and
  two minor responses. Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 31
  (53%) patients, the most common being fatigue (five [9%]), decreased
  neutrophil count (five [9%]), headache (three [5%]), and neutropenia
  (three [5%]).Dabrafenib plus trametinib showed clinically meaningful
  activity in patients with BRAFV600E mutation-positive recurrent or
  refractory high-grade glioma and low-grade glioma, with a safety profile
  consistent with that in other indications. BRAFV600E testing could
  potentially be adopted in clinical practice for patients with

Abstract:
  Hyperactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is
  common in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations
  in BRAF, RAS, and upstream receptor tyrosine kinases. To characterize
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of
  lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large
  panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for
  BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells
  with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive
  to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions.
  Supporting its classification as a "driver" mutation in the cells in
  which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to
  substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR
  kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK
  phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK
  inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR
  inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR
  and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions
  define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by
  prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we
  developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection
  of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we
  confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC
  tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a
  distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase
  domain mutations in EGFR.

Description:
  In these two phase II studies (Italy and U.S. locations), BRAF
  V600E-mutant hairy-cell leukemia was treated with vemurafenib at a dose
  of 960 mg twice daily to investigate its efficacy. The overall response
  rates were 96% (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median
  of 8 weeks in the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12
  weeks in the U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% and 42%
  in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian trial, the median
  relapse-free survival was 9 months; the relapse-free survival was
  significantly longer among patients who had a complete response than
  among those who had a partial response (19 months vs. 6 months; HR,
  0.26; 95% CI: 0.10 - 0.68; p = 0.006). The median treatment-free
  survival was 21.5 months in all 26 patients who could be evaluated, and
  it did not differ significantly between the group of patients who had a
  complete response and the group of those who had a partial response (25
  months and 18 months, respectively; p = 0.21). In the U.S. trial, at 1
  year, the rate of progression-free survival was 73% (95% CI: 55 - 97)
  and the rate of overall survival was 91% (95% CI: 79 - 99). Disease
  progression occurred in 7 of 24 patients, including 3 patients who had
  had a complete response and 4 who had had a partial response. At 1 year
  after response, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 27% (95% CI: 7 -
  51). Lastly, the frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK–positive
  leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass
  reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism.

Abstract:
  BRAF V600E is the genetic lesion underlying hairy-cell leukemia. We
  assessed the safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib
  in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment
  with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine
  analogues.We conducted two phase 2, single-group, multicenter studies of
  vemurafenib (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily)--one in Italy and one in
  the United States. The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks
  in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U.S. study. Primary end points
  were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall
  response rate (in the U.S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28
  patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36
  planned patients) in the U.S. trial.The overall response rates were 96%
  (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in
  the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the
  U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% (9 of 26 patients)
  and 42% (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian
  trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free
  survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6
  months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free
  survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U.S. trial,
  at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73% and the overall
  survival rate was 91%. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade
  1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were
  rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated
  with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent
  persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow
  at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a
  resistance mechanism.A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly
  effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

  AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) is a potent small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2
  that is in phase 2 clinical development.AZD6244 was tested against the
  Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro panel (1 nM-10
  microM). In vivo AZD6244 was tested at a dose of 100 mg/kg administered
  orally twice daily 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Subsequently, AZD6244
  was evaluated against two juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA)
  xenografts using once and twice daily dosing schedules. Phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 was used as a surrogate for in vivo inhibition of MEK1/2 was
  determined by immunoblotting.At the highest concentration used in vitro
  (10 microM) AZD6244 only inhibited growth by 50% in 5 of the 23 cell
  lines. Against the in vivo tumor panels, AZD6244 induced significant
  differences in EFS distribution in 10 of 37 (27%) solid tumor models and
  0 of 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) models. There were no
  objective responses. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated at this dose and
  schedule AZD6244 completely inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation. AZD6244
  was evaluated against two JPA xenografts, BT-35 (wild-type BRAF) and
  BT-40 (mutant [V600E] BRAF). BT-40 xenografts were highly sensitive to
  AZD6244, whereas BT-35 xenografts progressed on AZD6244 treatment.At the
  dose and schedule of administration used, AZD6244 as a single agent had
  limited in vitro and in vivo activity against the PPTP tumor panels
  despite inhibition of MEK1/2 activity. However, AZD6244 was highly
  active against BT-40 JPA xenografts that harbor constitutively activated
  BRAF, causing complete regressions.

Abstract:
  Oncogenic conversion of BRAF occurs in approximately 44% of papillary
  thyroid carcinomas and 24% of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. In
  papillary thyroid carcinomas, this mutation is associated with an
  unfavorable clinicopathologic outcome. Our aim was to exploit BRAF as a
  potential therapeutic target for thyroid carcinoma.We used RNA
  interference to evaluate the effect of BRAF knockdown in the human
  anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines FRO and ARO carrying the BRAF
  V600E (V600EBRAF) mutation. We also exploited the effect of BAY 43-9006
  [N-(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(4-(2-methylcarbamoyl
  pyridin-4-yl)oxyphenyl)urea], a multikinase inhibitor able to inhibit
  RAF family kinases in a panel of six (V600E)BRAF-positive thyroid
  carcinoma cell lines and in nude mice bearing ARO cell xenografts.
  Statistical tests were two sided.Knockdown of BRAF by small inhibitory
  duplex RNA, but not control small inhibitory duplex RNA, inhibited the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade and the growth of ARO
  and FRO cells (P < 0.0001). These effects were mimicked by thyroid
  carcinoma cell treatment with BAY 43-9006 (IC50 = 0.5-1 micromol/L; P <
  0.0001), whereas the compound had negligible effects in normal
  thyrocytes. ARO cell tumor xenografts were significantly (P < 0.0001)
  smaller in nude mice treated with BAY 43-9006 than in control mice. This
  inhibition was associated with suppression of phospho-mitogen-activated
  protein kinase levels.BRAF provides signals crucial for proliferation of
  thyroid carcinoma cells spontaneously harboring the (V600E)BRAF mutation
  and, therefore, BRAF suppression might have therapeutic potential in
  (V600E)BRAF-positive thyroid cancer.

Abstract:
  Dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated BRAF, has clinical activity with a
  manageable safety profile in studies of phase 1 and 2 in patients with
  BRAF(V600)-mutated metastatic melanoma. We studied the efficacy of
  dabrafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutated metastatic melanoma.We
  enrolled patients in this open-label phase 3 trial between Dec 23, 2010,
  and Sept 1, 2011. This report is based on a data cutoff date of Dec 19,
  2011. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, stage
  IV or unresectable stage III BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive melanoma were
  randomly assigned (3:1) to receive dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily,
  orally) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks).
  Patients were stratified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer
  stage (unresectable III+IVM1a+IVM1b vs IVM1c). The primary endpoint was
  investigator-assessed progression-free survival and was analysed by
  intention to treat; safety was assessed per protocol. This study is
  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227889.Of the 733
  patients screened, 250 were randomly assigned to receive either
  dabrafenib (187 patients) or dacarbazine (63 patients). Median
  progression-free survival was 5·1 months for dabrafenib and 2·7 months
  for dacarbazine, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·30 (95% CI 0·18-0·51;
  p<0·0001). At data cutoff, 107 (57%) patients in the dabrafenib group
  and 14 (22%) in the dacarbazine group remained on randomised treatment.
  Treatment-related adverse events (grade 2 or higher) occurred in 100
  (53%) of the 187 patients who received dabrafenib and in 26 (44%) of the
  59 patients who received dacarbazine. The most common adverse events
  with dabrafenib were skin-related toxic effects, fever, fatigue,
  arthralgia, and headache. The most common adverse events with
  dacarbazine were nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, fatigue, and asthenia.
  Grade 3-4 adverse events were uncommon in both groups.Dabrafenib
  significantly improved progression-free survival compared with
  dacarbazine.GlaxoSmithKline.

Abstract:
  The BRAF V600E missense mutation is known to be present in a subset of
  central nervous system tumors. We report a patient with a BRAF V600E
  mutated pilomyxoid astrocytoma who failed multiple conventional
  chemotherapy regimens. Treatment with vemurafenib, a molecularly
  targeted therapy against the mutant BRAF V600E kinase, combined with
  vinblastine resulted in tumor regression. Furthermore, this patient
  experienced almost immediate progression of disease after holding
  vemurafenib for only 2-3 weeks, suggesting that the tumor response is
  vemurafenib dependent. This population of patients may benefit from
  targeted therapy and testing of individual tumors for BRAF mutations is
  justified.

Abstract:
  We show that BRAF(V600E) initiates an alternative pathway to colorectal
  cancer (CRC), which progresses through a hyperplasia/adenoma/carcinoma
  sequence. This pathway underlies significant subsets of CRCs with
  distinctive pathomorphologic/genetic/epidemiologic/clinical
  characteristics. Genetic and functional analyses in mice revealed a
  series of stage-specific molecular alterations driving different phases
  of tumor evolution and uncovered mechanisms underlying this stage
  specificity. We further demonstrate dose-dependent effects of oncogenic
  signaling, with physiologic Braf(V600E) expression being sufficient for
  hyperplasia induction, but later stage intensified Mapk-signaling
  driving both tumor progression and activation of intrinsic tumor
  suppression. Such phenomena explain, for example, the inability of p53
  to restrain tumor initiation as well as its importance in invasiveness
  control, and the late stage specificity of its somatic mutation.
  Finally, systematic drug screening revealed sensitivity of this CRC
  subtype to targeted therapeutics, including Mek or combinatorial
  PI3K/Braf inhibition.

Abstract:
  KRAS and BRAF activating mutations drive tumorigenesis through
  constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. As these tumours represent
  an area of high unmet medical need, multiple allosteric MEK inhibitors,
  which inhibit MAPK signalling in both genotypes, are being tested in
  clinical trials. Impressive single-agent activity in BRAF-mutant
  melanoma has been observed; however, efficacy has been far less robust
  in KRAS-mutant disease. Here we show that, owing to distinct mechanisms
  regulating MEK activation in KRAS- versus BRAF-driven tumours, different
  mechanisms of inhibition are required for optimal antitumour activity in
  each genotype. Structural and functional analysis illustrates that MEK
  inhibitors with superior efficacy in KRAS-driven tumours (GDC-0623 and
  G-573, the former currently in phase I clinical trials) form a strong
  hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking
  MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. Conversely, potent
  inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK is required for strong
  inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours, resulting in
  superior efficacy in this genotype with GDC-0973 (also known as
  cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials.
  Our study highlights that differences in the activation state of MEK in
  KRAS-mutant tumours versus BRAF-mutant tumours can be exploited through
  the design of inhibitors that uniquely target these distinct activation
  states of MEK. These inhibitors are currently being evaluated in
  clinical trials to determine whether improvements in therapeutic index
  within KRAS versus BRAF preclinical models translate to improved
  clinical responses in patients.

Abstract:
  Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that harbours a BRAF V600E mutation
  (BRAF MT) is associated with poorer outcomes. However, whether this
  mutation is predictive of treatment benefit from anti-epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is uncertain.We
  conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled
  trials (RCTs) published up to July 2014 that evaluated the effect of
  BRAF MT on the treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC.Seven RCTs
  met the inclusion criteria for assessment of overall survival (OS),
  whereas eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of
  progression-free survival (PFS). For RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours, the hazard
  ratio for OS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs was 0.97 (95% CI; 0.67-1.41),
  whereas the hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI; 0.70-0.95) for RAS WT/BRAF WT
  tumours. However, the test of interaction (P=0.43) was not statistically
  significant, highlighting that the observed differences in the effect of
  anti-EGFR mAbs on OS according to the BRAF mutation status may be due to
  chance alone. Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard
  ratio was 0.86 (95% CI; 0.61-1.21) for RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours as
  compared with 0.62 (95% CI; 0.50-0.77) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours (test
  of interaction, P=0.07).This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is
  insufficient evidence to definitively state that RAS WT/BRAF MT
  individuals attain a different treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for
  mCRC compared with RAS WT/BRAF WT individuals. As such, there are
  insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR mAb therapy for
  patients with RAS WT/BRAF MT mCRC.

Abstract:
  Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a well-defined clinicopathological entity
  whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure.We searched for HCL-
  associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing of the
  whole exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the
  peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated
  by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL.Whole-exome
  sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were
  confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in
  BRAF that results in the BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is
  oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic
  lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients
  with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the
  195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who
  were evaluated carried the BRAF V600E variant, including 38 patients
  with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas
  or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells
  expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF
  kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK
  mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of
  BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720,
  a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in
  phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was
  present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may
  have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy
  of HCL. (Funded by Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro and

Abstract:
  The recent findings brought the necessity of testing the mutational
  status of a series of genes which had been already identified as
  responsible for melanomas development and progression, such as BRAF,
  CKIT and PTEN: the consequent results are, in fact, essential to guide
  the assessment of the novel treatment protocols based on tailored
  targeted therapies. We present here the case of a 66 year-old male
  patient, diagnosed with an advanced melanoma in June 2011, and treated
  with Dabrafenib for double mutant metastatic disease. The patient was
  referred to our attention for a large exophytic malignant melanoma on
  the left shoulder. After complete surgical excision and elective lymph
  node dissection for presence of metastatic sentinel lymph node, the
  patient has started high-dose interferon alfa-2b injections as adjuvant
  therapy for a complete negative staging. The treatment was interrupted
  in August 2011 due to the appearance of metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor
  burden was rapidly growing reaching in few months the size of a tennis
  ball for the tumor mass located in the shoulder. Mutational study of the
  tumor revealed a double BRAF mutation on V-600E and V600M. This finding
  incited us to enroll the patient in compassionate Dabrafenib clinical
  trial. The therapy was started on may 2012 at 150 mg bid dosage. Almost
  surprisingly for the rapidity of the effect, one week later the lesion
  on the shoulder has reduced its size by 60% and one month later it has
  completely disappeared from sight. CT scan of June 2012 documented the
  astonishing clinical response.

Abstract:
  The AURELIA trial demonstrated that adding Bevacizumab to chemotherapy
  significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) for platinum
  resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Recently, immunotherapy also
  presented potential anti-tumor effects in several malignant solid
  tumors. This study aimed to investigate whether combining anti-PD-L1
  Atezolizumab with BEV may have a synergistic effect and enhance the
  efficacy of both treatments in cisplatin resistant epithelial ovarian
  cancer (CREOC). We retrospectively analyzed 124 epithelial ovarian
  cancer (EOC) patients from Gynecologic Oncology Department of Tianjin
  Cancer Hospital between January 2013 and June 2018, who all were
  diagnosed with cisplatin resistance due to progressing <6 months after
  completing platinum-based therapy. Based on responding to at least 2
  cycles of Bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy (BC), these Patients were
  divided into BC response group and BC non-response group.
  Immunohistochemistry was used to detect that PD-L1 expression and tumor
  angiogenesis-related proteins (VEGF and Semaphorin4D) in tissues from
  124 patients with CREOC. The positive expressions of PD-L1, VEGF, and
  Semaphorin4D (SEMA4D) were found in 58.73, 50.79, and 71.43% of the 63
  cases CREOC tissues with BC response, respectively, which were
  significantly higher than that in the 61 cases BC non-response group (P
  < 0.05). PD-L1 expression correlated with SEMA4D and VEGF positively (r
  = 0.344 and 0.363, P < 0.001). Over-expressions of PD-L1, VEGF and
  SEMA4D are associated with more malignant clinicopathologic
  characteristics of CREOC Patients. In survival analysis, patients'
  response to BC was the independent factor for evaluation of PFS and
  overall survival (OS). Cell functional assays showed that Atezolizumab
  in combination with Bevacizumab inhibited the proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780cis in
  vitro synergistically, which maybe associate with Bevacizumab
  suppressing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and PD-L1
  expression by targeting STAT3. Furthermore, Bevacizumab and Atezolizumab
  induced synergistic anti-tumor effect in vivo. These findings suggest a
  novel therapeutic strategy for cisplatin resistant recurrent EOC and its
  mechanism warrants further study.

Abstract:
  Oncogenic BRAF mutations are found in several tumor types, including
  melanomas and colorectal cancers. Tumors with BRAF mutations have
  increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and
  heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or
  extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To
  identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated
  clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF
  V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to
  MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which
  exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance
  through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-
  naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed
  similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal
  cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of
  phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK
  (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of
  AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by
  treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the
  abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells.
  Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or
  BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells
  compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings
  implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK
  and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a
  clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of
  resistance.

Abstract:
  BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of
  patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance
  is almost universal. We sought to identify the core resistance pathways
  and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We
  show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were
  detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations,
  mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common.
  We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among
  22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core
  drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same
  tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring
  extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth
  emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution
  marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness.
  Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF
  inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core
  pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Abstract:
  In the Medical Research Council (MRC) COIN trial, the epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody cetuximab was added to standard
  chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with
  the aim of assessing effect on overall survival.In this randomised
  controlled trial, patients who were fit for but had not received
  previous chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer were randomly
  assigned to oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (arm A), the
  same combination plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent chemotherapy
  (arm C). The choice of fluoropyrimidine therapy (capecitabine or infused
  fluouroracil plus leucovorin) was decided before randomisation.
  Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical
  Trials Unit using minimisation. Treatment allocation was not masked. The
  comparison of arms A and C is described in a companion paper. Here, we
  present the comparison of arm A and B, for which the primary outcome was
  overall survival in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. Analysis was
  by intention to treat. Further analyses with respect to NRAS, BRAF, and
  EGFR status were done. The trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448.1630
  patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to standard
  therapy and 815 to addition of cetuximab). Tumour samples from 1316
  (81%) patients were used for somatic molecular analyses; 565 (43%) had
  KRAS mutations. In patients with KRAS wild-type tumours (arm A, n=367;
  arm B, n=362), overall survival did not differ between treatment groups
  (median survival 17·9 months [IQR 10·3-29·2] in the control group vs
  17·0 months [9·4-30·1] in the cetuximab group; HR 1·04, 95% CI
  0·87-1·23, p=0·67). Similarly, there was no effect on progression-free
  survival (8·6 months [IQR 5·0-12·5] in the control group vs 8·6 months
  [5·1-13·8] in the cetuximab group; HR 0·96, 0·82-1·12, p=0·60). Overall
  response rate increased from 57% (n=209) with chemotherapy alone to 64%
  (n=232) with addition of cetuximab (p=0·049). Grade 3 and higher skin
  and gastrointestinal toxic effects were increased with cetuximab (14 vs
  114 and 67 vs 97 patients in the control group vs the cetuximab group
  with KRAS wild-type tumours, respectively). Overall survival differs by
  somatic mutation status irrespective of treatment received: BRAF mutant,
  8·8 months (IQR 4·5-27·4); KRAS mutant, 14·4 months (8·5-24·0); all
  wild-type, 20·1 months (11·5-31·7).This trial has not confirmed a
  benefit of addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in
  first-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
  Cetuximab increases response rate, with no evidence of benefit in
  progression-free or overall survival in KRAS wild-type patients or even
  in patients selected by additional mutational analysis of their tumours.
  The use of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in
  first-line chemotherapy in patients with widespread metastases cannot be
  recommended.Cancer Research UK, Cancer Research Wales, UK Medical

Abstract:
  B cell lymphoma and melanoma harbor recurrent mutations in the gene
  encoding the EZH2 histone methyltransferase (EZH2), but the carcinogenic
  role of these mutations is unclear. Here we describe a mouse model in
  which the most common somatic Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation
  (EZH2(Y646F) in human; Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse) is conditionally expressed.
  Expression of Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse B cells or melanocytes caused high-
  penetrance lymphoma or melanoma, respectively. Overexpression of the
  anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, but not the oncoprotein Myc, or loss of the
  tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) further
  accelerated lymphoma progression. Expression of the mutant Braf but not
  the mutant Nras oncoprotein further accelerated melanoma progression.
  Although expression of Ezh2(Y641F) globally increased the abundance of
  trimethylated Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), it also caused a
  widespread redistribution of this repressive mark, including a loss of
  H3K27me3 that was associated with increased transcription at many loci.
  These results suggest that Ezh2(Y641F) induces lymphoma and melanoma
  through a vast reorganization of chromatin structure, inducing both
  repression and activation of polycomb-regulated loci.

Description:
  In this case study, a 28-year-old male with BRAF V600E-mutant anaplastic
  ganglioglioma was started with vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily in
  March 2015 for tumour recurrence despite one surgical resection and
  adjuvant radiation therapy. He had a partial response with a tumour
  shrinkage up to 55% according to RANO (response assessment in neuro-
  oncology) criteria that was observed after 4 cycles. However, the
  response to vemurafenib only lasted for 14 cycles until May 2016 when
  his brain MRI showed local recurrence. Whole-exome sequencing of matched
  tumour and germline DNA and RNA sequencing was carried out and the BRAF
  V600E mutation was confirmed, along with a focal homozygous deletion of
  CDKN2A and CDKN2B at the 9p21 locus. No additional molecular alteration
  in MAPK genes was found. Three other somatic variants were identified. A
  TET2 (p.Glu796Lys) mutation was found in both tumours. Mutations of BAX
  (p.Leu76Arg) and AXIN2 (p.Pro455Lys) were only detected in the recurrent
  tumour. These 3 genetic variants were not previously reported in the
  literature or in public databases, including ExAC, ClinVar, and COSMIC,
  and were annotated as variants of unknown significance. The patient was
  then started with combined vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily and
  cobimetinib at 60 mg daily, 21 days every 28 days in November 2016. A
  complete response was observed after 3 months of combined treatment. At
  the last follow-up, after 16 months of treatment, there is no evidence
  of recurrence.

Abstract:
  Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of childhood.
  Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single
  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however,
  standard cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess
  the activity of selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients.The
  Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study
  in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.
  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score
  greater than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or
  progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard
  therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients were assigned to six
  unique strata according to histology, tumour location, NF1 status, and
  BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the results of strata 1 and 3.
  Stratum 1 comprised patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma
  harbouring either one of the two most common BRAF aberrations
  (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAFV600E [Val600Glu] mutation). Stratum 3
  comprised patients with any neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated
  paediatric low-grade glioma (WHO grades I and II). Selumetinib was
  provided as capsules given orally at the recommended phase 2 dose of 25
  mg/m2 twice daily in 28-day courses for up to 26 courses. The primary
  endpoint was the proportion of patients with a stratum-specific
  objective response (partial response or complete response), as assessed
  by the local site and sustained for at least 8 weeks. All responses were
  reviewed centrally. All eligible patients who initiated treatment were
  evaluable for the activity and toxicity analyses. Although the trial is
  ongoing in other strata, enrolment and planned follow-up is complete for
  strata 1 and 3. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
  NCT01089101.Between July 25, 2013, and June 12, 2015, 25 eligible and
  evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 1, and between Aug 28, 2013,
  and June 25, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to
  stratum 3. In stratum 1, nine (36% [95% CI 18-57]) of 25 patients
  achieved a sustained partial response. The median follow-up for the 11
  patients who had not had a progression event by Aug 9, 2018, was 36·40
  months (IQR 21·72-45·59). In stratum 3, ten (40% [21-61]) of 25 patients
  achieved a sustained partial response; median follow-up was 48·60 months
  (IQR 39·14-51·31) for the 17 patients without a progression event by Aug
  9, 2018. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were elevated
  creatine phosphokinase (five [10%]) and maculopapular rash (five [10%]).
  No treatment-realted deaths were reported.Selumetinib is active in
  recurrent, refractory, or progressive pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring
  common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated paediatric low-grade glioma.
  These results show that selumetinib could be an alternative to standard
  chemotherapy for these subgroups of patients, and have directly led to
  the development of two Children's Oncology Group phase 3 studies
  comparing standard chemotherapy to selumetinib in patients with newly
  diagnosed paediatric low-grade glioma both with and without NF1.National

  Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, and AstraZeneca.

Abstract:
  BRAF genomic alterations are the most common oncogenic drivers in
  pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG). Arm 1 (n = 77) of the ongoing phase 2
  FIREFLY-1 (PNOC026) trial investigated the efficacy of the oral,
  selective, central nervous system-penetrant, type II RAF inhibitor
  tovorafenib (420 mg m-2 once weekly; 600 mg maximum) in patients with
  BRAF-altered, relapsed/refractory pLGG. Arm 2 (n = 60) is an extension
  cohort, which provided treatment access for patients with RAF-altered
  pLGG after arm 1 closure. Based on independent review, according to
  Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology High-Grade Glioma (RANO-HGG)
  criteria, the overall response rate (ORR) of 67% met the arm 1
  prespecified primary endpoint; median duration of response (DOR) was
  16.6 months; and median time to response (TTR) was 3.0 months (secondary
  endpoints). Other select arm 1 secondary endpoints included ORR, DOR and
  TTR as assessed by Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Low-
  Grade Glioma (RAPNO) criteria and safety (assessed in all treated
  patients and the primary endpoint for arm 2, n = 137). The ORR according
  to RAPNO criteria (including minor responses) was 51%; median DOR was
  13.8 months; and median TTR was 5.3 months. The most common treatment-
  related adverse events (TRAEs) were hair color changes (76%), elevated
  creatine phosphokinase (56%) and anemia (49%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred
  in 42% of patients. Nine (7%) patients had TRAEs leading to
  discontinuation of tovorafenib. These data indicate that tovorafenib
  could be an effective therapy for BRAF-altered, relapsed/refractory
  pLGG. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04775485 .

Abstract:
  TAPUR is a phase II basket trial evaluating the antitumor activity of
  commercially available targeted agents in patients with advanced cancer
  and genomic alterations known to be drug targets. The results of a
  cohort of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with BRAF mutations
  treated with cobimetinib (C) plus vemurafenib (V) are reported.Eligible
  patients had advanced CRC, no standard treatment options, measurable
  disease (RECIST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
  0-2, adequate organ function, tumors with BRAF V600E/D/K/R mutations,
  and no MAP2K1/2, MEK1/2, or NRAS mutations. C was taken 60 mg orally
  once daily for 21 days followed by seven days off, and V was taken 960
  mg orally twice daily. Simon's two-stage design was used with a primary
  study end point of objective response or stable disease of at least 16
  weeks duration. Secondary end points were progression-free survival,
  overall survival, and safety.Thirty patients were enrolled from August
  2016 to August 2018; all had CRC with a BRAF V600E mutation except one
  patient with a BRAF K601E mutation. Three patients were not evaluable
  for efficacy. Eight patients with partial responses and six patients
  with stable disease of at least 16 weeks duration were observed for
  disease control and objective response rates of 52% (95% CI, 35 to 65)
  and 30% (95% CI, 14 to 50), respectively. The null hypothesis of 15%
  disease control rate was rejected (P < .0001). Thirteen patients had at
  least one grade 3 adverse event or serious adverse event at least
  possibly related to C + V: anemia, decreased lymphocytes, dyspnea,
  diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, fatigue, hypercalcemia,
  hypophosphatemia, rash, photosensitivity, and upper gastrointestinal
  hemorrhage.The combination of C + V has antitumor activity in heavily
  pretreated patients with CRC with BRAF mutations.

Abstract:
  The NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial assigns patients age 1-21 years with
  relapsed or refractory solid tumors, lymphomas, and histiocytic
  disorders to phase II studies of molecularly targeted therapies on the
  basis of detection of predefined genetic alterations. Patients with
  tumors harboring mutations or fusions driving activation of the mitogen-
  activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway were treated with the MEK
  inhibitor selumetinib.Patients received selumetinib twice daily for
  28-day cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The
  primary end point was objective response rate; secondary end points
  included progression-free survival and tolerability of
  selumetinib.Twenty patients (median age: 14 years) were treated. All
  were evaluable for response and toxicities. The most frequent diagnoses
  were high-grade glioma (HGG; n = 7) and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 7).

  (n = 8), NRAS (n = 3), and HRAS (n = 1), inactivating mutations in NF1

  Three patients had a best response of stable disease including two
  patients with HGG (NF1 mutation, six cycles; KRAS mutation, 12 cycles).

  demonstrated promising responses in some pediatric tumors (eg, low-grade

  with treatment-refractory tumors harboring MAPK alterations demonstrated
  limited efficacy, indicating that pathway mutation status alone is

Abstract:
  The NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial assigns patients age 1-21 years with
  relapsed or refractory solid tumors, lymphomas, and histiocytic
  disorders to phase II studies of molecularly targeted therapies on the
  basis of detection of predefined genetic alterations. Patients with
  tumors harboring mutations or fusions driving activation of the mitogen-
  activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway were treated with the MEK
  inhibitor selumetinib.Patients received selumetinib twice daily for
  28-day cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The
  primary end point was objective response rate; secondary end points
  included progression-free survival and tolerability of
  selumetinib.Twenty patients (median age: 14 years) were treated. All
  were evaluable for response and toxicities. The most frequent diagnoses
  were high-grade glioma (HGG; n = 7) and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 7).
  Twenty-one actionable mutations were detected: hotspot mutations in KRAS
  (n = 8), NRAS (n = 3), and HRAS (n = 1), inactivating mutations in NF1
  (n = 7), and BRAF V600E (n = 2). No objective responses were observed.
  Three patients had a best response of stable disease including two
  patients with HGG (NF1 mutation, six cycles; KRAS mutation, 12 cycles).

Abstract:
  Despite progress, 2-year pancreatic cancer survival remains dismal. We
  evaluated a biomarker-driven, combination/N-of-one strategy in 18
  patients (advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer) (from Molecular Tumor
  Board). Targeted agents administered/patient = 2.5 (median) (range,
  1-4); first-line therapy (N = 5); second line, (N = 13). Comparing
  patients (high versus low degrees of matching) (matching score ≥50%
  versus <50%; reflecting number of alterations matched to targeted agents
  divided by number of pathogenic alterations), survival was significantly
  longer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI],
  0.078-0.76, P = 0.016); clinical benefit rates (CBR) (stable disease ≥6
  months/partial/complete response) trended higher (45.5 vs 0.0%, P =
  0.10); progression-free survival, HR, 95% CI, 0.36 (0.12-1.10) (p =
  0.075). First versus ≥2nd-line therapy had higher CBRs (80.0 vs 7.7%, P
  = 0.008). No grade 3-4 toxicities occurred. The longest responder
  achieved partial remission (17.5 months) by co-targeting MEK and CDK4/6
  alterations (chemotherapy-free). Therefore, genomically matched targeted
  agent combinations were active in these advanced pancreatic cancers.
  Larger prospective trials are warranted.

Description:
  5577 colon carcinoma tumors were evaluated for BRAF, KRAS, and mismatch
  repair status. From those successfully evaluated, 201 had microsatellite
  instability (MSI or MSI-H) and BRAF V600E, 72 had MSI and KRAS exon 2
  mutation, and 204 had MSI and no KRAS or BRAF mutation. In addition, 279
  were microsatellite stable (MSS or MSI-L) and BRAF V600E, 1450 had MSI
  and KRAS exon 2 mutation, and 2205 had MSI and no KRAS or BRAF mutation.

  MSS patients with BRAF V600E were associated with shorter time to
  recurrence (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.23 to 1.92, P < .001).
  Overall survival in MSS with BRAF V600E was poorer than wild-type (HR =
  2.01, 95% CI = 1.56 to 2.57, P < .001).

  This prognostic effect was not seen in BRAF or KRAS mutant patients that
  had MSI tumors.

Abstract:
  The prognostic value of BRAF and KRAS mutations within microsatellite-
  unstable (MSI) and microsatellite-stable (MSS) subgroups of resected
  colon carcinoma patients remains controversial. We examined this
  question in prospectively collected biospecimens from stage III colon
  cancer with separate analysis of MSI and MSS tumors from patients
  receiving adjuvant FOLFOX +/- cetuximab in two adjuvant therapy
  trials.Three groups were defined: BRAF Mutant, KRAS Mutant, and double
  wild-type. The analytic strategy involved estimation of study-specific
  effects, assessment of homogeneity of results, and then analysis of
  pooled data as no differences in patient outcome were found between
  treatment arms in both trials. Associations of mutations with patient
  outcome were analyzed, and multivariable models were adjusted for
  treatment and relevant factors.Four thousand four hundred eleven tumors
  were evaluable for BRAF and KRAS mutations and mismatch repair status;
  3934 were MSS and 477 were MSI. In MSS patients, all BRAF V600E
  mutations (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23
  to 1.92, P < .001), KRAS codon 12 alterations, and p.G13D mutations (HR
  = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.40 to 1.83, P < .001) were associated with shorter
  time to recurrence (TTR) and shorter survival after relapse (SAR; HR =
  3.02 , 95% CI = 2.32 to 3.93, P < .001, and HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.01 to
  1.44, P = .04, respectively). Overall survival (OS) in MSS patients was
  poorer for BRAF-mutant patients (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.56 to 2.57, P <
  .001) and KRAS-mutant patients (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.38 to 1.91, P <
  .001) vs wild-type. No prognostic role of KRAS or BRAF mutations was
  seen in MSI patients. Furthermore, no interaction was found between
  treatment arm (with or without cetuximab) and KRAS and BRAF mutations
  for TTR or OS in MSS patients.In a pooled analysis of resected stage III
  colon cancer patients receiving adjuvant FOLFOX, BRAF or KRAS mutations
  are independently associated with shorter TTR, SAR, and OS in patients
  with MSS, but not MSI, tumors. Future clinical trials in the adjuvant
  setting should consider these mutations as important stratification
  factors.
