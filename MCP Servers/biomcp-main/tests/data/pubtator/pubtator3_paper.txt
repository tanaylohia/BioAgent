Abstract
PubTator 3.0 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/) is a biomedical literature resource using state-of-the-art AI techniques to offer
semantic and relation searches for key concepts like proteins, genetic variants, diseases and chemicals. It currently provides over one billion
entity and relation annotations across approximately 36 million PubMed abstracts and 6 million full-text articles from the PMC open access
subset, updated weekly. PubTator 3.0’s online interface and API utilize these precomputed entity relations and synonyms to provide advanced
search capabilities and enable large-scale analyses, streamlining many complex information needs. We showcase the retrieval quality of PubTator
3.0 using a series of entity pair queries, demonstrating that PubTator 3.0 retrieves a greater number of articles than either PubMed or Google
Scholar, with higher precision in the top 20 results. We further show that integrating ChatGPT (GPT-4) with PubTator APIs dramatically improves
the factuality and verifiability of its responses. In summary, PubTator 3.0 offers a comprehensive set of features and tools that allow researchers
to navigate the ever-expanding wealth of biomedical literature, expediting research and unlocking valuable insights for scientific discovery.

Introduction
The biomedical literature is a primary resource to address information needs across the biological and clinical sciences (1),
however the requirements for literature search vary widely.
Activities such as formulating a research hypothesis require
an exploratory approach, whereas tasks like interpreting the
clinical significance of genetic variants are more focused.
Traditional keyword-based search methods have long
formed the foundation of biomedical literature search (2).
While generally effective for basic search, these methods also
have significant limitations, such as missing relevant articles

due to differing terminology or including irrelevant articles because surface-level term matches cannot adequately represent
the required association between query terms. These limitations cost time and risk information needs remaining unmet.
Natural language processing (NLP) methods provide substantial value for creating bioinformatics resources (3–5), and
may improve literature search by enabling semantic and relation search (6). In semantic search, users indicate specific
concepts of interest (entities) for which the system has precomputed matches regardless of the terminology used. Relation search increases precision by allowing users to specify the

type of relationship desired between entities, such as whether
a chemical enhances or reduces expression of a gene. In this regard, we present PubTator 3.0, a novel resource engineered to
support semantic and relation search in the biomedical literature. Its search capabilities allow users to explore automated
entity annotations for six key biomedical entities: genes, diseases, chemicals, genetic variants, species, and cell lines. PubTator 3.0 also identifies and makes searchable 12 common
types of relations between entities, enhancing its utility for
both targeted and exploratory searches. Focusing on relations
and entity types of interest across the biomedical sciences allows PubTator 3.0 to retrieve information precisely while providing broad utility (see detailed comparisons with its predecessor in Supplementary Table S1).

The PubTator 3.0 online interface, illustrated in Figure 1
and Supplementary Figure S1, is designed for interactive literature exploration, supporting semantic, relation, keyword,
and Boolean queries. An auto-complete function provides semantic search suggestions to assist users with query formulation. For example, it automatically suggests replacing either ‘COVID-19 or "SARS-CoV-2 infection’ with the semantic term ‘@DISEASE_COVID_19 . Relation queries – new to
PubTator 3.0 – provide increased precision, allowing users
to target articles which discuss specific relationships between
entities.
PubTator 3.0 offers unified search results, simultaneously
searching approximately 36 million PubMed abstracts and
over 6 million full-text articles from the PMC Open Access Subset (PMC-OA), improving access to the substantial
amount of relevant information present in the article full text
(7). Search results are prioritized based on the depth of the relationship between the query terms: articles containing identifiable relations between semantic terms receive the highest
priority, while articles where semantic or keyword terms cooccur nearby (e.g. within the same sentence) receive secondary
priority. Search results are also prioritized based on the article
section where the match appears (e.g. matches within the title receive higher priority). Users can further refine results by
employing filters, narrowing articles returned to specific publication types, journals, or article sections.
PubTator 3.0 is supported by an NLP pipeline, depicted in
Figure 2A. This pipeline, run weekly, first identifies articles
newly added to PubMed and PMC-OA. Articles are then processed through three major steps: (i) named entity recognition,
provided by the recently developed deep-learning transformer
model AIONER (8), (ii) identifier mapping and (iii) relation
extraction, performed by BioREx (9) of 12 common types of
relations (described in Supplementary Table S2).
In total, PubTator 3.0 contains over 1.6 billion entity annotations (4.6 million unique identifiers) and 33 million relations
(8.8 million unique pairs). It provides enhanced entity recognition and normalization performance over its previous version,
PubTator 2 (10), also known as PubTator Central (Figure 2B
and Supplementary Table S3). We show the relation extraction performance of PubTator 3.0 in Figure 2C and its comparison results to the previous state-of-the-art systems (11–13)
on the BioCreative V Chemical-Disease Relation (14) corpus,
finding that PubTator 3.0 provided substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, when evaluating a randomized sample of
entity pair queries compared to PubMed and Google Scholar,

Materials and methods
Data sources and article processing
PubTator 3.0 downloads new articles weekly from the BioC
PubMed API (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/
APIs/BioC-PubMed/) and the BioC PMC API (https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PMC/) in BioCXML format (16). Local abbreviations are identified using
Ab3P (17). Article text and extracted data are stored internally using MongoDB and indexed for search with Solr, ensuring robust and scalable accessibility unconstrained by external
dependencies such as the NCBI eUtils API.

Entity recognition and normalization/linking
PubTator 3.0 uses AIONER (8), a recently developed named
entity recognition (NER) model, to recognize entities of six
types: genes/proteins, chemicals, diseases, species, genetic
variants, and cell lines. AIONER utilizes a flexible tagging
scheme to integrate training data created separately into a
single resource. These training datasets include NLM-Gene
(18), NLM-Chem (19), NCBI-Disease (20), BC5CDR (14),
tmVar3 (21), Species-800 (22), BioID (23) and BioRED (15).
This consolidation creates a larger training set, improving
the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data. Furthermore,
it enables recognizing multiple entity types simultaneously,
enhancing efficiency and simplifying the challenge of distinguishing boundaries between entities that reference others,
such as the disorder ‘Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency’ and the
protein ‘Alpha-1 antitrypsin’. We previously evaluated the performance of AIONER on 14 benchmark datasets (8), including the test sets for the aforementioned training sets. This evaluation demonstrated that AIONER’s performance surpasses
or matches previous state-of-the-art methods.
Entity mentions found by AIONER are normalized (linked)
to a unique identifier in an appropriate entity database. Normalization is performed by a module designed for (or adapted
to) each entity type, using the latest version. The recentlyupgraded GNorm2 system (24) normalizes genes to NCBI
Gene identifiers and species mentions to NCBI Taxonomy.
tmVar3 (21), also recently upgraded, normalizes genetic variants; it uses dbSNP identifiers for variants listed in dbSNP
and HGNV format otherwise. Chemicals are normalized by
the NLM-Chem tagger (19) to MeSH identifiers (25). TaggerOne (26) normalizes diseases to MeSH and cell lines to
Cellosaurus (27) using a new normalization-only mode. This
mode only applies the normalization model, which converts
both mentions and lexicon names into high-dimensional TFIDF vectors and learns a mapping, as before. However, it
now augments the training data by mapping each lexicon
name to itself, resulting in a large performance improvement for names present in the lexicon but not in the annotated training data. These enhancements provide a significant overall improvement in entity normalization performance (Supplementary Table S3).

System overview

PubTator 3.0 consistently returns a greater number of articles with higher precision in the top 20 results (Figure 2D and
Supplementary Table S4).

neously extract 12 types of relations across eight entity
type pairs: chemical–chemical, chemical–disease, chemical–
gene, chemical–variant, disease–gene, disease–variant, gene–
gene and variant–variant. Detailed definitions of these relation types and their corresponding entity pairs are presented in
Supplementary Table S2. Deep-learning methods for relation
extraction, such as BioREx, require ample training data. However, training data for relation extraction is fragmented into
many datasets, often tailored to specific entity pairs. BioREx
overcomes this limitation with a data-centric approach, reconciling discrepancies between disparate training datasets to
construct a comprehensive, unified dataset.
We evaluated the relations extracted by BioREx using performance on manually annotated relation extraction datasets
as well as a comparative analysis between BioREx and notable
comparable systems. BioREx established a new performance
benchmark on the BioRED corpus test set (15), elevating the
performance from 74.4% (F-score) to 79.6%, and demonstrating higher performance than alternative models such as
transfer learning (TL), multi-task learning (MTL), and stateof-the-art models trained on isolated datasets (9). For PubTator 3.0, we replaced its deep learning module, PubMedBERT
(28), with LinkBERT (29), further increasing the performance
to 82.0%. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis between BioREx and SemRep (11), a widely used rule-

based method for extracting diverse relations, the CD-REST
(13) system, and the previous state-of-the-art system (12), using the BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation corpus test
set (14). Our evaluation demonstrated that PubTator 3.0 provided substantially higher F-score than previous methods.

Programmatic access and data formats
PubTator 3.0 offers programmatic access through its
API and bulk download. The API (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/) supports keyword, entity and relation search, and also supports exporting
annotations in XML and JSON-based BioC (16) formats and tab-delimited free text. The PubTator 3.0 FTP
site (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/PubTator3) provides bulk downloads of annotated articles and extraction
summaries for entities and relations. Programmatic access supports more flexible query options; for example,
the information need ‘what chemicals reduce expression
of JAK1?’ can be answered directly via API (e.g. https:
//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3-api/relations?
e1=@GENE_JAK1&type=negative_correlate&e2=Chemical)
or by filtering the bulk relations file. Additionally, the PubTator 3.0 API supports annotation of user-defined free
text.

Case study I: entity relation queries
We analyzed the retrieval quality of PubTator 3.0 by preparing a series of 12 entity pairs to serve as case studies for
comparison between PubTator 3.0, PubMed and Google
Scholar. To provide an equal comparison, we filtered about
30% of the Google Scholar results for articles not present
in PubMed. To ensure that the number of results would
remain low enough to allow filtering Google Scholar results for articles not in PubMed, we identified entity pairs
first discussed together in the literature in 2022 or later. We
then randomly selected two entity pairs of each of the following types: disease/gene, chemical/disease, chemical/gene,
chemical/chemical, gene/gene and disease/variant. None of

the relation pairs selected appears in the training set. The
comparison was performed with respect to a snapshot of the
search results returned by all search engines on 19 May 2023.
We manually evaluated the top 20 results for each system and
each query; articles were judged to be relevant if they mentioned both entities in the query and supported a relationship
between them. Two curators independently judged each article, and discrepancies were discussed until agreement. The
curators were not blinded to the retrieval method but were
required to record the text supporting the relationship, if relevant. This experiment evaluated the relevance of the top 20
results for each retrieval method, regardless of whether the
article appeared in PubMed.

Case study II: retrieval-augmented generation
In the era of large language models (LLMs), PubTator 3.0 can
also enhance their factual accuracy via retrieval augmented
generation. Despite their strong language ability, LLMs are
prone to generating incorrect assertions, sometimes known
as hallucinations (30,31). For example, when requested to
cite sources for questions such as ‘which diseases can doxorubicin treat’, GPT-4 frequently provides seemingly plausible but nonexistent references. Augmenting GPT-4 with PubTator 3.0 APIs can anchor the model’s response to verifiable
references via the extracted relations, significantly reducing
hallucinations.
We assessed the citation accuracy of responses from three
GPT-4 variations: PubTator-augmented GPT-4, PubMedaugmented GPT-4 and standard GPT-4. We performed a qualitative evaluation based on eight questions selected as follows. We identified entities mentioned in the PubMed query
logs and randomly selected from entities searched both frequently and rarely. We then identified the common queries for
each entity that request relational information and adapted
one into a natural language question. Each question is therefore grounded on common information needs of real PubMed
users. For example, the questions ‘What can be caused by
tocilizumab?’ and ‘What can be treated by doxorubicin?’
are adapted from the user queries ‘tocilizumab side effects’
and ‘doxorubicin treatment’ respectively. Such questions typically require extracting information from multiple articles
and an understanding of biomedical entities and relationship descriptions. Supplementary Table S5 lists the questions
chosen.
We augmented the GPT-4 large language model (LLM) with
PubTator 3.0 via the function calling mechanism of the OpenAI ChatCompletion API. This integration involved prompt-

ing GPT-4 with descriptions of three PubTator APIs: (i) find
entity ID, which retrieves PubTator entity identifiers; (ii) find
related entities, which identifies related entities based on an
input entity and specified relations and (iii) export relevant
search results, which returns PubMed article identifiers containing textual evidence for specific entity relationships. Our
instructions prompted GPT-4 to decompose user questions
into sub-questions addressable by these APIs, execute the
function calls, and synthesize the responses into a coherent final answer. Our prompt promoted a summarized response by
instructing GPT-4 to start its message with ‘Summary:’ and requested the response include citations to the articles providing
evidence. The PubMed augmentation experiments provided
GPT-4 with access to PubMed database search via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) E-utils
APIs (32). We used Azure OpenAI Services (version 2023-0701-preview) and GPT-4 (version 2023-06-13) and set the decoding temperature to zero to obtain deterministic outputs.
The full prompts are provided in Supplementary Table S6.
PubTator-augmented GPT-4 generally processed the questions in three steps: (i) finding the standard entity identifiers, (ii) finding its related entity identifiers and (iii) searching PubMed articles. For example, to answer ‘What drugs can
treat breast cancer?’, GPT-4 first found the PubTator entity
identifier for breast cancer (@DISEASE_Breast_Cancer) using
the Find Entity ID API. It then used the Find Related Entities
API to identify entities related to @DISEASE_Breast_Cancer
through a ‘treat’ relation. For demonstration purposes, we
limited the maximum number of output entities to five. Finally,
GPT-4 called the Export Relevant Search Results API for the
PubMed article identifiers containing evidence for these relationships. The raw responses to each prompt for each method
are provided in Supplementary Table S6.
We manually evaluated the accuracy of the citations in
the responses by reviewing each PubMed article and verifying whether each PubMed article cited supported the
stated relationship (e.g. Tamoxifen treating breast cancer).
Supplementary Table S5 reports the proportion of the cited
articles with valid supporting evidence for each method. GPT4 frequently generated fabricated citations, widely known
as the hallucination issue. While PubMed-augmented GPT-4
showed a higher proportion of accurate citations, some articles cited did not support the relation claims. This is likely
because PubMed is based on keyword and Boolean search and
does not support queries for specific relationships. Responses
generated by PubTator-augmented GPT-4 demonstrated the
highest level of citation accuracy, underscoring the potential of PubTator 3.0 as a high-quality knowledge source for
addressing biomedical information needs through retrievalaugmented generation with LLMs such as GPT-4. In our experiment, using Azure for ChatGPT, the cost was approximately $1 for two questions with GPT-4-Turbo, or 40 questions when downgraded to GPT-3.5-Turbo, including the cost
of input/output tokens.

Discussion
Previous versions of PubTator have fulfilled over one billion
API requests since 2015, supporting a wide range of research
applications. Numerous studies have harnessed PubTator annotations for disease-specific gene research, including efforts
to prioritize candidate genes (33), determine gene–phenotype
associations (34), and identify the genetic underpinnings of

Our analysis is summarized in Figure 2D, and
Supplementary Table S4 presents a detailed comparison
of the quality of retrieved results between PubTator 3.0,
PubMed and Google Scholar. Our results demonstrate that
PubTator 3.0 retrieves a greater number of articles than the
comparison systems and its precision is higher for the top
20 results. For instance, PubTator 3.0 returned 346 articles
for the query ‘GLPG0634 + ulcerative colitis’, and manual
review of the top 20 articles showed that all contained
statements about an association between GLPG0634 and
ulcerative colitis. In contrast, PubMed only returned a total
of 18 articles, with only 12 mentioning an association. Moreover, when searching for ‘COVID19 + PON1’, PubTator 3.0
returns 212 articles in PubMed, surpassing the 43 articles
obtained from Google Scholar, only 29 of which are sourced
from PubMed. These disparities can be attributed to several
factors: (i) PubTator 3.0’s search includes full texts available
in PMC-OA, resulting in significantly broader coverage of
articles, (ii) entity normalization improves recall, for example,
by matching ‘paraoxonase 1’ to ‘PON1’, (iii) PubTator 3.0
prioritizes articles containing relations between the query
entities, (iv) Pubtator 3.0 prioritizes articles where the entities
appear nearby, rather than distant paragraphs. Across the 12
information retrieval case studies, PubTator 3.0 demonstrated
an overall precision of 90.0% for the top 20 articles (216 out
of 240), which is significantly higher than PubMed’s precision
of 81.6% (84 out of 103) and Google Scholar’s precision of
48.5% (98 out of 202).
